20984,B002QWP89S,A17TDUBB4Z1PEC,genuine Greenies best price,"These are genuine Greenies product, not a knockoff.  My dogs love them!  It is their favorite treat.  I have 2 small dogs, both under 10 lbs. and the Teenie size is perfect for them.  I paid $22.37 for this 96-pack and it is by far the best price I have found anywhere.  I wish these were part of the Subscribe & Save program.",5
20985,B002QWP89S,ABQH3WAWMSMBH,Perfect for our little doggies,"Our dogs love Greenies, but of course, which doggies don't?  I bought this for my dashchund and minpin, and it's perfect!  A great price for a great product.  Who could ask for more.",5
20986,B002QWP89S,AVTY5M74VA1BJ,dogs love greenies,"What can I say, dogs love greenies. They begg for them all the time. They always sit by the cupboard and ask for more.",5
20987,B002QWP89S,A13TNN54ZEAUB1,Greenies review,This review is for a box of Greenies Lite for my dog. The package came quickly and was packaged appropriately. I was very satisfied with this purchase and with the seller.,5
20988,B002QWP89S,A1AO8A38JUDVAF,Magic Breath Chews for your dog,I highly recommend these chews for your dog. They do exactly what they say that they will do; freshen your dog's breath!<br /><br />I found them to be significantly cheaper to buy them at Amazon compared to the chain pet stores; at least $10 cheaper as of Sept. 2011.<br /><br />I have read that some dogs do not chew them well enough and have choked. I have not had that happen to my dog but it is probably something you need to take into consideration.<br /><br />My advice is to buy a smaller bag at a pet store first and see if they work for your animal. Then come back and buy them here!,5
20989,B002QWP89S,AH261OMJCV5U8,Greenies for Seniors,I have always used Greenies for my dogs. THese for seniors are wonderful. I have an elderly bulldog with really bad breath. She used to swallow the original Greenies whole so I quit buying them for her. She actually does chew these and eat them and they make a big difference in how her breath smells. Great product and the price is better than I have seen it in some local pet stores.,5
20990,B002QWP89S,A3VVIU4JE56U4K,Kinda Pricy but good!,"If you've got hard chewers (like one of our dogs), these things won't really work for the 'brushing' aspect -- they're bussted up and swallowed pretty quickly. We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product.",5
20991,B002QWP89S,A3MWZ2E112KIY4,DOG LOVES THESE,"I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth.",5
20992,B002QWP89S,A2PRQXWZRHTKE3,Great treat and good for dental health,"This is a fabulous treat for my little cavalier king charles. He looks forward to it after his daily dental cleaning. I cut each greenie into smaller pieces, because JB (for James Bond) has long ears and he chews on the smaller pieces without letting anything fall on the floor and sticking to his ears.",5
20993,B002QWP89S,A3TDMH1Z8CUBAF,My dogs love these chews!,"I am the lucky parent of three dogs. I alternate their teeth cleaning chews and they love the Greenies and the Checkups best. Thanks to Amazon, I don't have to pay for S&H, which living in Alaska, usually costs a fortune!! Thank you Amazon!! I prefer to purchase from our local pet store, but they aren't able to get the Greenies or the Checkups, so I'm very happy that I can order them through Amazon.",5
20994,B002QWP89S,A37565LZHTG1VH,Awesome!,This is a great product. My 2 year old Golden Retriever hates to have his teeth brushed and this product made his teeth white again. Great seller and great price too!,5
21000,B002QWP89S,A3NYAP2AZPWQJ5,My dog loves these,My dog loves greenies - she waits for them everyday!  We give her one regular sized one per day and the teenies as treats for going outside etc.  I have heard that these do not digest easily if your dog is not a chewer.  My dog is a chewer so it works out great.  She is addicted!,5

21005,B002QWP89S,A2C64W88KUQKYO,Teenie Greenies,"My little dogs really like these ""teenie"" Greenies dental chewies. Not only are they good for the dogs' teeth, the dogs consider them a treat! I am not able to find these really small Greenies elsewhere; the smallest I can find in the stores are ""petites"" which are too large for these little dogs to chew.  So, thank you for making these available.  I was very pleased with the service; these arrived here quickly and in excellent condition!  I will order from this website again!",5
21006,B002QWP89S,A2ZNIKXT764IV4,Expensive treats but my dogs LOVE them!,"I have two Airedales.  They aren't fussy eaters - or snackers - but each gets a Greenie at bedtime.  We let them out in the yard for a bit before they go to bed and all I have to do is say ""Time for your Greenies!"" to make them race for the house and dance around until they get that bedtime snack.  It's their special treat and I love the fact that they actually have to chew them moderately slowly instead of just inhaling them!  The only drawback is that they're expensive.",5
21007,B002QWP89S,A3GON8WVDICI9P,Very happy with purchase,I was very happy with the quick delivery and how I was given a tracking method to determine where my Greenies were. I'll telling my friends and relatives about the good experience.,5
21009,B002QWP89S,A30F5VJRO3095U,My Silky Terrier loves these!,"He weighs 15 pounds, so he is just at the top of the range for the teenie size Greenies.  He likes them so much, he would probably prefer the Jumbo size!  I've given him these for his whole life, so I don't know if they get his teeth any cleaner than without them, but his teeth look pretty clean to me!",5
21010,B002QWP89S,A1F5004VYZ3AXH,Great for dog breath and teeth,Ive been buying this product for a few years and am very happy with it. My dog loves them.,5

21018,B002QWP89S,A11VCDXC7TGFTG,A great deal on Greenies,Paid only $22 with free shipping for 96 teenies compared to about $35 at the pet store. How can you go wrong with a deal like that?  The dog begs for his daily Greenie. Got to have them.,5
21019,B002QWP89S,A16MHMVUD5X4I7,Greenies for Dogs,"How well the dogs would eat them.  Glad to know the benefits the animals get from chewing them, both for teeth cleaning and breathe.  Safety us always an issue.",5
21021,B002QWP89S,A1REM7I2ZEE195,Best doggie treat,"I buy the teenie greenies and break them in half for our dogs.  They go nuts over them no matter what the size.  Having them in a ""lite"" version is even better because the vet did tell me they are high in calories.  Don't know what they put in these things to make them so appealing, but haven't known a dog yet who doesn't love them.  Hope they are also doing the job they are meant to do.",5
21022,B002QWP89S,A1CLSM0DDBU4PN,Dog loves Greenies,Greenies are always a good product.  Our dog loves them and reminds us if we forget to give him one.  Plus I love the price on Amazon and can't always get them locally.,5
21023,B002QWP89S,A35JBDYRVSRHH0,Great teeth,My vet is always surprised how clean my 8 year old dog's teeth are and I attribute this the his daily Greenie.,5
21024,B002QWP89S,A11QSEA6DZM4FZ,radtechmom,Our beautiful Belle loves her daily toothbrush treat. Amazon provides an awesome price and delivers them to our doorstep. That makes it even handier. The Greenies are a proven winner for a more natural breath freshening dog treat. Too bad Greenies doesn't get more 'green' with their packaging and lose the outer box that they use. The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!,5
21025,B002QWP89S,A3P8H4629FM490,my dogs love these,"In September, I adopted 2 adult border terrier mixes from The Shelter Pet project and the oldest girl had a few ""breath"" issues.  Heard about Greenies and have not been disappointed.  The two of them love their treat before I go to work and it is comical to see them chew and chew and chew, since that is what removes the tartar. Amazon has much better pricing then the pet centers, so I love it.  Try them for your pet, they will love it.",5
21027,B002QWP89S,A38OA79EH91ESR,Puppies love them!,"These tinnie greenies make the perfect ""out the door"" bribe for my Cavlier King Charles Babies. I think they almost look forward to me going to work now.  Barkley is 21 lbs & Gypsy is 18 so while they are a bit larger than the recommended size for the product it really works out perfectly helping keep the pounds off.<br /><br />Having shopped around, you are saving about ten dollars by ordering from Amazon rather than going into a big box pet store.",5
21028,B002QWP89S,AEIQ20BHN9JFI,My Dog Says YUMMMMM,"My Chihuahua has horrible horrible breath.... and she loves to get in your face and give kisses to everyone. These help, and she loves to eat them. Good thing she can't reach the counter!",5

Also, his breath has been noticeably fresher since he has been having these. So far, best price on Amazon. The local pet food chains' sale prices has not yet come close to the regular price of these 96 count 'Teenie' packs. Can't vouch on the benefit of nutritional value of these, but the vet says our mini is in great shape ...right where he is suppose to be.",5

21054,B002QWP89S,A3J9T78MGOZ0F6,My dogs love them!,Did some research because my dogs have bad breath and dirty teeth. I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.,5
21055,B002QWP89S,AWVJ6RRO0Y1FM,Dog Loves!,My dog loves these treats and they are lite too.  I have been buying them for the last 5 years,5
21057,B002QWP89S,A1TEFN18LEQ6R4,Why do they increase the price each month on the product?,I have subsribed to the monthly shipment of Greenies 27 oz canister teenie 96 count product and each month the price increases.  If i sign up today the price drops to $19.94.  Why the increase?  Seems like they lock you in for a scheduled order and then take advantage of you hoping that you won't notice the price increases.<br /><br />The product is great and my dogs love them but the business practice of the price hikes is terrible.,5
21058,B002QWP89S,A2EJVJ5G4DYGV3,My Puppy Loves These,"Einstein our puppy loves the Greenies.  He get's one at night before bed as a bribe for going into his kennel.

21060,B002QWP89S,A1CMD08Z49PGKQ,My vet suggested this.,My two dogs love these.  Now as to do they work.  I honestly do not know.  Both of my dogs are right now at what my vet calls stage two on dental health.  Stage four is the worst on his scale.  I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!  I will come back and update this after their next check up which should be around August of 2013.,5
21061,B002QWP89S,A3BKR6QASTTL4D,Very pleased,"Nothing negative to say about this buying experience.  My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care (brushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's breath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh - inside the box is an airtight resealable bag.",5

I have found that my dogs love the Greenies and they do a good job of helping to keep the tarter build up off their teeth! I have one dog that is very particular about his treats and what he will chew on but he loves the Greenies, in fact my dogs will do most anything I ask so long as they know they get a Greenie afterwards!",5

I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item.

They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!",5
21084,B002QWP89S,A3MXO5BIX3RZ25,my lil' beast is crazy for greenies!!,"i still worry about the rumored threat to dogs from these treats, but they have changed the formula so i am assuming all is well with them.  and i am assuming since they are front and center in most pet places that they are safe.  and my italian greyhound is obsessed with them.  they make her (usually hideous) breath smell fresh and clean and have really made a difference in the cleanliness of her teeth.  i always make sure to watch her while she's eating it, not only for her safety, but because it is freaking adorable to watch her chew on it.  just a tip, these are cheaper from entirelypets from amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Greenies-Dental-Chews-ounce-Teenie/dp/B001CWEC2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1266273814&sr=8-1",5
21085,B002QWP89S,A37RIRXE3WECZ,My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!,"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.",5
21086,B002QWP89S,A33HGS0F6NVBRA,Greenies - Catnip for dogs,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them.",5
21087,B002QWP89S,A1W7BIVI3O46Q,such great treats!,"I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.",5
21089,B002QWP89S,A2ST78JTMA1OUM,It's like crack for dogs...,"First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...",5

He has a very sensitive stomach and can only have boiled chicken and canned and dry prescription diet ID<br />I brush his teeth every night and afterwards he gets a ""greenie""  he loves them and I love that they don't upset his stomach.<br />Our Vet said they should be ok for Pepper.  And they are.  Paying about 40.00 elsewhere, I'm really happy to find them on Amazon.com for a little over half of that.  Pepper is happy and I'm happy.",5
21092,B002QWP89S,ACTMZJ4EUOC65,Addictive to dogs,"It's got something in there that is like crack for dogs. I buy the largest size I can find. I like them better than rawhide, for what they do. Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.",5

She does not seem to tire of these unlike many treats she has tried.<br />I have heard that the official word is that these do not really promote good breath.<br />Maybe they just limit the amount of bad breath. Whatever. This box is a three<br />month supply so is a reasonably economical way to give my dog something she really likes.,5

It reeked like a dead fish, and I couldn't handle her puppy kisses any more.  Then, I saw an ad on TV for a competing product, but found these to be a better deal. They are worth every penny.<br /><br />The Teenie Greenies arrived yesterday. Just ONE solved the problem. I gave it to her half expecting her to turn her nose up. Instead, she loved it. This morning she greeted me with sloppy kisses and wiggles. I instinctively cringed, waiting for that fetid smell. But there was NO smell! Zilch. Zip. Nada.",5

Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the ""peanut butter pills.""",5

However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs.

21159,B002QWP89S,AHRJEVNHM7W3R,love those greenies,I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.,5
21160,B002QWP89S,A3KI8A89Z4PNOP,Great greenies,My dog loves these treats and the 96 count box is the best deal. They come in a foil package in the box so they stay fresh till the last one.,5

Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.  Greenies are good for my dog's dental health and are not dangerous as are rawhides or toys with squeeking mechanisms which can choke a dog.  Just the sight of the Greenie box, and she knows it's nap time or time for a treat.",5

21171,B002QWP89S,A363VYG6RS9WUS,Keep on Munching,"My puppy loves this product.  The moment he has a Greenie in his mouth, he'll begin to munch.  I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.  The product is just hard enough so that my puppy can keep gnawing on it, but it is simultaneously soft enough for him to sink his teeth into (providing assistance for teeth development).  I definitely recommend this product.",5
21172,B002QWP89S,A32BYHWKU8GU7L,Very Effective,"My veterinarian recommended these.  My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.  His top part is huge but his legs- not so much.  Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here.",5

21193,B002QWP89S,A264UDSHTHG6SU,Great Price!,I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.,5
21194,B002QWP89S,A3MQJDWDYH3LCE,A teethsaver!,"About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!",5
21196,B002QWP89S,AMATOIG271SMX,So Happy to find this vendor!!!,"This is a fantastic deal!! My dogs love greenies but at over $20 per bag at the local pet supply store, I couldn't afford to give them one everyday. I order these again and again.",5

21198,B002QWP89S,AJDC6ZW7JDJWD,Great treats,"Any edible bone can cause a dog to choke, but Greenies changed their formula about a year ago to make it more digestible.  I love the product.",5
21199,B002QWP89S,A30UXI3KH3WA51,"Sticky, but delicious.","My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case.",5
21200,B002QWP89S,A20EXXV8A0YGQJ,Maggie's Favorite,"We have tried other chew products for our dog and these are by far her favorite.

21202,B002QWP89S,A3LGVJIFKK52RE,Great for older dogs,My son brought these home one day for our 12 year old Cocker Spaniel.

Still too high, but.....<br /><br />Since I'm buying something, I think is way overpriced...  yet I still buy it, should say it all.  My gang loves the darn things.

They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.

I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.

The younger one has lots of digestive issues. They both get 1 greenie a week. Vet says their teeth look great and it's helped with the bad breath. Also, doesn't give the little one runny poop, which is nice. Only problem is they are expensive, that's why they get one a week.",5

21357,B002QWP89S,A233GJE85LAE9H,Freshens breath and my Yorkie loves 'em!!,"When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!",5
21358,B002QWP89S,A326QNHW72LDF4,It's like crack for dogs,"These things aren't cheap, but there's nothing that gets my dog more excited than the thought of getting a Greenie. Whatever is inside of them is something he can't get enough of. I don't know about whether they are healthy, they don't seem to clean his teeth, but they certainly make him a very happy pooch.",5

21360,B002QWP89S,A2D3JYUBKYXABF,Absolutely fabulous,"I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog.",5
21361,B002QWP89S,A3V8UMB6LJ5V6K,Great product for your dog !,"Have used greenies since they came out and they definitely help keep your dog's teeth clean.

I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the ""large or X-Lg"" greenie where you get fewer pieces.",5

Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed.",5

No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that ""tail-wagging drool"" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)",5

21417,B002QWP89S,ANPR395RBZ9HB,Dog loves them,The new Greenies are so much easier for our dog to chew up. She only gets 1-2 per week but enjoys them each time. Buying them via Amazon always saves us money.,5
21418,B002QWP89S,AI1OMTFUB375Q,My Dog Goes CRAZY!!,"I don't write too many reviews, but I read them all the time...so I though it was high time I wrote a review for this product (my dog told me to).  I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.",5
21419,B002QWP89S,A1YZYHCKDK2K4I,My Pooch loves them,"Since my pet does not like having his teeth cleaned, I have been giving him greenies for the past six years.  Each vet check-up confirms that he has no plaque buildup.  He is a picky eater but loves the taste of them as well.",5
21420,B002QWP89S,A16ITFLKSAUQJC,Greenies are a plus for dogs teeth.,I buy greenies for  my two best friends.  My vet commented on how their teeth are looking good because of the greenies.  My ten year old Scottish terrier and my four year old Standard Poodle will dance circles for their greenis..lol.  How cool is that?,5
21421,B002QWP89S,A3U58GFUQAOZLE,Greenies for Owen,Our Newf Owen is a Senior citizen now so wanted to switch him over to a treat that fit his mature lifestyle.  He loves these just as he did the regular Greenies.,5

21423,B002QWP89S,A37XGB2EAFFLQ5,Great deal,"Our terrier mix adores Greenies (haven't met a dog who doesn't love them, actually)... they kind of have a gummy-bear quality. We give him one before we leave for work so he has a little distraction (only takes him a few minutes to finish one). These are $1.50/ea at our local pet supply store, so buying them in bulk is the way to go. We bought them from Entirely Pets and got a great deal with fast shipping.",5
21424,B002QWP89S,A2ZM5F1K76ZFUV,"Can't beat this price, came super fast.",Excellent product. Your dogs will love them. I wouldn't recommend them for dogs over 25 pounds as they may pose a choking hazard for quick eaters.,5

Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.  But with purchasing different pricing each time through Amazon is something I don't understand.  It would be great for return loyal patrons to purchase same price or honor discount pricing.,5
21431,B002QWP89S,A1L26X0GUJ16T,the best reward/bribe ever,"I have three terriers and most often foster another dog. My dogs will do ANYTHING for a Greenie. One races through agility, because a Greenie awaits him at the end of the class--in addition to small treats after each run.  Right now I am fostering a traumatized little poodle who feared his crate; a Greenie at the back of the crate and he will quickly go in. And Greenies are good for their breath/teeth, healthy and easily digestible. My vet, too, recommends them.",5

21441,B002QWP89S,AS0Q5SJAGMVYA,Great!,My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.  He gets one per day and always lets me know when it is time to have one.  The cost is a little high so I buy them in the larger quantity.,5
21442,B002QWP89S,A267QVA1GWNZMY,Always a great choice,I buy these time and time again. I noticed an immediate improvement in my dog's breath (no stink...he gets in my face all the time) and there's no plaque on his teeth.,5

These are an absolute must. The dog must have them. That is all there is to it. The fact that we could find the ""lite"" greenies was an added bonus.",5
21445,B002QWP89S,A16FRUOWEKAU7C,Proof is in the Vet's Bill,"My ""Sammy"" is very picky on treats but he loves these and the best thing is he is 7 and a half years old and has never had to have his teeth cleaned. The Vet says his teeth are clear of tartar so I've saved enough in Vet bills to more than pay for his special chews",5
21446,B002QWP89S,A1NADKSHMF3S6K,#1 dog treat!,"These are our dog's absolute favorite treat!  As recommended, we only give one each day and make sure he doesn't get choked.  These are not as tough to chew as the old formula, which took him longer to chew.  Greenies are supposed to help clean dogs' teeth and breath, but we buy them because he loves them so much.  The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.  Be sure to get the correct size so your dog can't gobble them whole.",5

Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.",5

He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size.

Don't worry about Greenies causing allergies!  The main source of allergies is CORN in dog food.  Do your little one a favor and go to a grain free or reduced grain dog food.  When you think about it, wild dogs didn't eat corn meal!  If your little one has allergies, you will be amazed at the immediate healing.",5

Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The ""Senior"" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet.",5

I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.",5

In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",5

I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie.

We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.

I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.

I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat.

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.

74734,B0026RQTGE,A37RIRXE3WECZ,My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!,"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.",5
74735,B0026RQTGE,A33HGS0F6NVBRA,Greenies - Catnip for dogs,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them.",5
74736,B0026RQTGE,A1W7BIVI3O46Q,such great treats!,"I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.",5
74738,B0026RQTGE,A2ST78JTMA1OUM,It's like crack for dogs...,"First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...",5

Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.",5

Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the ""peanut butter pills.""",5

However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs.

They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the ""risk"" with Greenies.

She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!

Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.

74843,B0026RQTGE,A3MQJDWDYH3LCE,A teethsaver!,"About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!",5

74848,B0026RQTGE,A30UXI3KH3WA51,"Sticky, but delicious.","My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case.",5

75004,B0026RQTGE,A1X8CUY24POQL8,Greenies,My dogs love the greenies and their breath is alway good smelling. A good product.<br />I purchased this through Amazon for a better prlice than I normally get.  This is an expensive little treat but worth it.,5
75005,B0026RQTGE,A21OJJ6C4DZDQT,Excellent deal!,Best deal on greenies out there! Came fast and without any problems. My dog loves them and they make his breath smell good.,5
75006,B0026RQTGE,A233GJE85LAE9H,Freshens breath and my Yorkie loves 'em!!,"When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!",5
75007,B0026RQTGE,A326QNHW72LDF4,It's like crack for dogs,"These things aren't cheap, but there's nothing that gets my dog more excited than the thought of getting a Greenie. Whatever is inside of them is something he can't get enough of. I don't know about whether they are healthy, they don't seem to clean his teeth, but they certainly make him a very happy pooch.",5
75008,B0026RQTGE,AJCAVTHZFM0J3,Best price - great quality product,My dog loves these things - one in the morning<br /><br />Everyone makes a compliment  on her breath smelling good,5
75009,B0026RQTGE,A2D3JYUBKYXABF,Absolutely fabulous,"I have a notoriously finicky Chihuahua who wouldn't eat a regular dog treat if you coated it the best tasting thing on earth, and she certainly wouldn't let me brush her teeth. Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog.",5
75010,B0026RQTGE,A3V8UMB6LJ5V6K,Great product for your dog !,"Have used greenies since they came out and they definitely help keep your dog's teeth clean.

Very impressed with the product.",5
75011,B0026RQTGE,A7G9M0IE7LABX,My Dog loves this,"Well, the ingredients list is a little questionable to me personally.<br />However, after comparing to most other brands, such as Nylabone, Pegetables etc, they all seem the same.<br />This is economically priced so it does not break the bank.<br />My dog loves and goes crazy for it, and I haven't heard of any problems/recalls with this product.<br /><br />So overall, it's great I guess.",5
75012,B0026RQTGE,A1NB11D41Z75P4,My greyhounds love teenie greenies,"I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the ""large or X-Lg"" greenie where you get fewer pieces.",5

(Seriously, if someone has ever accomplished this without the dog making various dramatic escape attempts and trying to eat the toothpaste, please tell me your secret.)  We just give them each one of these every day and a bunch of rawhide to chew on, seems to do the trick.",5

These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed.",5

My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh.

No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that ""tail-wagging drool"" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)",5

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.",5

The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.

Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.",5

He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day.

75173,B0026RQTGE,A3LIZY8BL6XPCO,Terrific Product for Doggie Breath!,"The Greenies ordered through Amazon is less expensive than the ""bricks & mortar"" stores; and I plan to order another box.  We received the product a few days after placing the order.<br /><br />Terrific product, and our lab loves this treat!",5
75174,B0026RQTGE,A2RZUAFCLKAOLQ,brandi,my dog brandi lovessssssssssssssssssss these greenies she cant get enough of them and i keep them in cabinet she will look at cabinet and than look at me and say ma can i please have a greenie im not kiddin shes a dog but she talks to me they have there own communication.<br />anyway whoever is leary about buying these trust me when i tell you they are worth every pennie and this seller got them out to me quick!!great product great seller what more can i say but<br />merry xmas and a happy healthy new year too!!,5
75175,B0026RQTGE,A2YQ2ZI65F37N8,our dogs love them,Our two greyhounds love the Greenies dental chews.  I prefer to buy them the smaller treats since they are both seniors now and don't like to chew on things for extended periods of time.  The regular size fits that need.,5
75177,B0026RQTGE,A17USQH314JOTA,Great Deal,"As always, amazing price on amazon. Paid the same price for 45 chews, as I did for half the amount at the local pet store. Product shipped extremely quick even using the super saver shipping. My dog absolutely loves these treats. She hates going to her crate, but if I grab one of these out of the box that it came in, show it to her, and say ""bed"" she literally sprints to her crate in anticipation. Highly Recommended. Oh and her breath is about half as stinky as it was before I started giving her these.",5
75179,B0026RQTGE,AULYLI7ZVLQUC,Greenies,"What can I say. To my dogs, giving them a Greenie is like giving them a steak! The minute they hear the box being take out of the closet they are right at my feet.",5
75180,B0026RQTGE,A2XC1DOGG1MY14,"Great for my old, spoiled dog","My elderly (soon-to-be 17) beagle, Dakota, is super picky about what he eats.  Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The ""Senior"" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.  Dakota gets one petite Greenies Senior treat everyday and he has never turned down an offer for one yet.",5
75185,B0026RQTGE,ABVE0SBRXFAFR,Greenies,"My dog loves her greenies, she gets one every morning, if I forget to give her one she lets me know it in no uncertain terms.<br />I buy them from Amazon because the price is right, petsmart wants to much for them.<br />I just ordered them yesterday, received them today.<br /><br />Thanks",5

I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.",5

They're pricey, but for a once a day treat I think they're worth it for keeping her teeth in good condition, not to mention seeing her big grin when we open the container.  We should've named her ""Greenie"" because that one word gets her attention like nothing else will.",5
75232,B0026RQTGE,A74SHV5ZD3RLT,Great product and free shipping to AK.  Can't beat that!,"I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",5

They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie.

I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow Labradors teeth so clean.

We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product.",5

My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.

The sealed inside bag would be plenty good enough. It keeps the treats fresh and takes up less space. The first thing we do is toss the box out--- what a waste!,5

Heard about Greenies and have not been disappointed.  The two of them love their treat before I go to work and it is comical to see them chew and chew and chew, since that is what removes the tartar.

Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.,5

I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!

I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item.

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.

329515,B002QWHJOU,A37RIRXE3WECZ,My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!,"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.",5
329516,B002QWHJOU,A33HGS0F6NVBRA,Greenies - Catnip for dogs,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them.",5

She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.",5
329519,B002QWHJOU,A2ST78JTMA1OUM,It's like crack for dogs...,"First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...",5

Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.",5

329531,B002QWHJOU,A3BUWBTRGMMJOB,Great Chew Treat,Greenies are the special treat we give our golden retriever and great pyrenee/golden retriever mix.  Greenies are hard enough that our dogs have to chew slowly but not so hard that I feel uncomfortable giving it to them.,5
329532,B002QWHJOU,A2WYY318G9XQQD,My Dog LOVES These!,"Plain and simple, my dog loves these. She dances, spins, & squeaks whenever one is brought out! While this makes me happy as well, it is important to say that regular feedings of 1 to 2 a week have helped avoid teeth cleanings and extractions over the years! Too bad they don't have an equivalent for humans!",5

They are easy on his teeth (not too hard, etc) and my vet complimented that his teeth are in good condition. Your dog may need teeth cleaning once in awhile (it's not a substitute) but it mitigates the tartar buildup effectively when given daily. Will buy over and over again.",5
329535,B002QWHJOU,AEZ8OREQVE2P,great treat! not too smelly,"For a picky boxer that doesn't like or eat many treats, she is addicted to these!  They aren't very chalky or too smelly and she enjoys the hard but soft enough texture for her big mouth/small teeth combo :)  These treats also don't leave any residue on the carpet which is very nice.",5

She knows that after supper she receives her greenie and she loves them.  It is the one thing that I can depend on her eating.  Since we do feed a lot of soft food, the greenie helps clean her teeth.  The price on these greenies is very good and they were fresh and came in a timely manner.",5

She ended up loving them,so I kept the small zip-lock pouch the sample size came in. I just take about 20 of the Greenies at a time from the large 96 chews container and refill the zip-lock pouch.*It also is a great way to bring some Greenies along with you when you are traveling with your dog!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQCJIG"">Greenies Treats for Dogs (5-15 lbs/2-7 kg)Mini Treat-Pak-Teenie 6 oz</a>",5

329560,B002QWHJOU,ASCE5545RQ01I,Greenies for a picky eater,"I had to pay a fortune to have our dog's teeth cleaned. Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the ""peanut butter pills.""",5
329561,B002QWHJOU,A2WUK1O9802GNW,My dog's favorite treat!,"Greenies are great dental chews that keep my dog with minimal plaque.<br />My 3 yr old loves it.<br />The price of the 96 Teenie Pack (or more) from Amazon is unbeatable.<br /><br />Of note, my dog didn't like it very much when he tried it the first time when he was 2 months old. He grew to love it more and more. So don't give up and give it to someone else if your puppy is not crazy about them from the first day.",5

329569,B002QWHJOU,A319SA019UXTLX,Great Deal!!,"Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that.",5
329570,B002QWHJOU,A33RAJU0FDA0S3,Greenies for a good price,"Well, they are Greenies.  Not much else to say about them besides it's a fantastic price.  They come in the green box shown, but inside is a re-sealable bag to keep them fresh which was really nice and actually a concern I had when I first purchased them.",5
329571,B002QWHJOU,A3BYTYZ0PQGG8,buy in bulk!,"My dogs love these greenies. Their teeth are super white from chewing on them and their breath somehow is no longer as stinky. The only thing is that they are a tad-overpriced, so I recommend buying them in bulk if you are truly satisfied with this product like I am.",5
329572,B002QWHJOU,A13S908SVO9MTN,Greenies are awesome!!,"My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the ""risk"" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!",5

She is SUPER picky with treats and food in general and she absolutely loves these!! She wants one all the time! Her bowel movements are not affected by them in a negative way. The only thing I would say that is a con is that they don't last very long! She eats them pretty quickly even though the material of them is pretty rock solid and her mouth is tiny.",5

I like to treat my kids now and again and they love them so much they have even taken to identifying these treats as ""greenies""! Yes I know it is typically the tone but they even get excited if you say the word green now, its crazy. So I'd say, get these for your kids they will love them so much you'll have a hard time denying them at least one a day. I know I do.",5

Let me tell you, I've gone to the vet several times during her first year for different reasons. The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy ""smile"" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word ""greenies"" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her. Because of a previous review i read about storing them in the container it comes in for a while caused maggots, i got really grossed out(has NEVER happened to me) so JUST IN CASE, i dump them in a snap seal, clear, plastic container.",5

329589,B002QWHJOU,AHRJEVNHM7W3R,love those greenies,I have a bichon beagle hybrid mix (called a glechon).  He just loves greenies. We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them. They are a little costly but I feel they're well worth the extra cost.,5

Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.

I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.  The product is just hard enough so that my puppy can keep gnawing on it, but it is simultaneously soft enough for him to sink his teeth into (providing assistance for teeth development).  I definitely recommend this product.",5

Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.  I thought the price was a bit steep but tried them on the word of the vet and for the obvious results we're getting I guess you get what you pay for here.",5

329623,B002QWHJOU,A264UDSHTHG6SU,Great Price!,I like to buy Greenies for my dog but they are very expensive even in multi-packs. If you purchase at online pet stores they are somewhat less expensive but not like the boxes offered on Amazon.  Dogs need clean teeth and healthy gums and Greenies will take care of both.  Easily digestible for my 13 year old Shi-Tzu.,5
329624,B002QWHJOU,A3MQJDWDYH3LCE,A teethsaver!,"About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!  Thank you Amazon for offering them at an affordable price with free shipping!",5

329629,B002QWHJOU,A30UXI3KH3WA51,"Sticky, but delicious.","My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case.",5

I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.

I also brush their teeth most nights so a combined effort and my dogs teeth have never needed to be cleaned which has saved their little bodies from the trauma of anesthesia. Feed the right size and ALWAYS watch your animal with any treat.",5

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!",5

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them. Her breath is fresh, her teeth are white and tartar free, and she's a very happy dog.",5

I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the ""large or X-Lg"" greenie where you get fewer pieces.",5

These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed.",5

My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh.

No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that ""tail-wagging drool"" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)",5

So funny!",5

If your dog enjoys the chewing and gnawing, make sure you get the proper size for your dog so they do not choke.

After spending $350 to get his teeth cleaned, and getting 15 teeth pulled due to decay, I was on a mission to find something he'd chew on to help clean his teeth. He LOVES these!He's around 12 lbs.

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.",5

Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.

The large box of Teenie size has 96, so they aren't that expensive at one a day.  Well worth the price for our loyal baby!  He's been enjoying them for several years with no problems.

A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.",5

We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size.

Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The ""Senior"" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.

I have one German Shorthair that is a notoriously finicky eater, and she has flat-out refused many varieties of dental bones.  Not only do the Greenies do a great job of keeping her teeth clean, but she practically does back flips when it's time for her daily chew.<br /><br />I have pointers between 45 and 60 pounds, and the regular size is great for them.  Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.  I give 1 per day to help with oral hygiene.  Based on that use of this product I have yet to find anything that compete with Greenies.",5

In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",5

I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie.

We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.

My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.

I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats.,5

I am going to monitor and see IF just maybe they will either still be a stage two in a year or maybe better.  If they maintain at stage two I would love it.  Teeth cleaning on dogs is very expensive so if this product works it will save me big bucks.  Here's hoping!

I decided to give her one Greenie everyday and see if it improved her teeth and gums. I have been giving her one a day for almost two months and her back teeth look so much better! I am very happy with this little experiment and she is too. She reminds me every night when it's time for her Greenie treat. She still has a slight issue with one of her front teeth, but I think it's because she mainly chews the Greenies on her back teeth. Such a great item.

I have German Shepards, Dobermans and medium sized hound dogs.  They all love their GB's and I find that because our Dobie tends to be a ""garbage belly"" (meaning she'll eat anything!), so sometimes she doesn't smell as nice as she should, really benefits from the ""green"" in Greenie Bones.  I would like to know where ""E. Antic"" gets his/her information from.....as I can find nothing that says they are ""deadly"", except for those people that haven't done responsible research (not just hearsay from some list).  If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.  Do we need to bring up ""NYLABONES""?????  Always be a responsible dog owner and supervise your dogs when giving any kind of treats.  Please don't be afraid of Greenie Bones because of E. Antic's post.  You can buy Greenie's in singles, so try one before you commit to a whole box.  I have friends that have dogs that don't really like them and that's okay.  My girls live for their morning GB's and I now give them Greenie ""Smart Biscuits"" for an afternoon snack.  They love the taste and we love them for the 'benefits'!!<br /><br />I respectfully request that Amazon and Amazon members make up their own minds, and not fall to the 'fear mongers' and ignorance amoung us.  Always supervise your dogs when giving treats - after all, they are the animals and we are supposed to be the 'smart' ones.....don't be afraid, do your homework, it always pays!",5

355606,B002QWP8H0,A37RIRXE3WECZ,My Dog's Favorite- and Amazon's the Place to Get Them!,"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them.",5
355607,B002QWP8H0,A33HGS0F6NVBRA,Greenies - Catnip for dogs,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them.",5
355608,B002QWP8H0,A1W7BIVI3O46Q,such great treats!,"I give these to my dog to help with her minor tartar problems. She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up.",5
355610,B002QWP8H0,A2ST78JTMA1OUM,It's like crack for dogs...,"First some history:<br />Our dog can't chew rawhide bones.  She has a habit of breaking off pieces & swallowing them whole.  We have had problems with blockages & constipation as a result -- everytime she has received a rawhide.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr old Beagle which was introduced to Greenies about 2 yrs ago.  We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs...",5

Rawhide strips or bones, when the dog gets down to that last part are slimy unswallowable messes that I've had to reach in and remove from the dog's throat. Nylabones edibles gave the dog the runs. Pressed rawhide chunks did the same. Greenies don't affect his digestion at all, and he's crazy about them. He has destroyed a Kong or two in his time.<br /><br />I don't know how much is due to his genes or to the greenies, but my 12 year old dog has better teeth than many 5 year olds.<br /><br />Like any other edible chew treat, however, don't leave your dog unattended until he's finished it.",5

Plus it was a difficult thing for her...she got very upset and was in pain for a few days. So I started using Greenies, and wow...they have her scheduled for a teeth cleaning that I will cancel, because it has kept her teeth so clean. Best of all, though, she is a very picky eater. Most things that are supposedly flavored to please dogs do not please her. She just won't eat them, but Greenies for teeth...she can't wait to have them. I just ask her if she wants to brush her teeth, and she is ready and waiting. The other night I got out her pills to give her for arthritis and made the mistake of getting out the greenie at the same time. She didn't want the pills although they were covered in peanut butter, which she usually loves. Once she finished the greenie, she wanted the ""peanut butter pills.""",5

However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs.

I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the ""risk"" with Greenies.

The first time her vet was happy to see that she had a healthy ""smile"" and hoped it continued, she was still a puppy. Since then, we moved to another city and she now has a different vet. This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word ""greenies"" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her.

We just had him into his vet for his checkup and the vet told us that his teeth were beautiful. He wanted to know what we did to keep them that way. The only thing we do is to give him greenies. I've had two other people comment on his teeth in the past month. I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath.

I actually got this product not only to keep my pup's teeth clean, but am using it to help my puppy teeth.

Basically he needs his weight managed all the time because we don't want knee problems to develop.  At his last trip Dr. Kragness said he had a bit of a tartar problem (organic food related) and to try a greenie a day.  Well he's been chewing them for about 12 days and his teeth look great and as an added benefit his breath is clean, still hot but clean smelling.  In addition I've noticed that he doesn't have a lot of doggy gas like usual.

355715,B002QWP8H0,A3MQJDWDYH3LCE,A teethsaver!,"About two years ago I adopted a little toy poodle from my local humane society.  She had been rescued from a puppy mill and was underweight, coated in fleas and had a broken jaw.  After trying to fix the jaw with a metal plate and it getting infected, we ended up having her lower left jaw along with all of her teeth on that sound of her mouth removed completely.  A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.  The last time I took her into the vet, they said she only had Grade 1 Dental Disease as opposed to the Grade 3 the year before -  Thank you Greenies for creating a delicious product that is helping to save my dog's few precious teeth!

355720,B002QWP8H0,A30UXI3KH3WA51,"Sticky, but delicious.","My Pug puppies absolutely love these bones.  The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!",5

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them.

I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.

My bog is 65 pounds but I give her the petite be causes it saves money and cuts calories. I have tried everything to get her breath smelling decent or even bearable and this is the only thing. One petite greenie once a day or once every two days keeps her breath minty fresh.

No other treat can compare as far as he's concerned -- and this is a dog who will eat just about anything.  He happily trots into his crate every night at bedtime because he knows that's when I'll give him this special treat.  Seriously, if he could skip, he would skip.  At a little over $1.40 per treat, Greenies are more expensive than I would typically pay, but I like how they freshen his breath, clean his teeth, & are generally healthy for him.  There may be other products out there that claim to have the same benefits, but none I've tried so far have that ""tail-wagging drool"" factor which, to be honest, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy at bedtime too :)",5

I have a Maltichon and she loves her mid-day treat.  Her breath was horrible, so I thought this might freshen it up a bit.  First of all, so goes BONKERS when I take this Greenie treat out.  The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out.",5

Every vet visit comments how well his teeth look with hardly any plaque at all; amazing!  I've pretty much invested a lot of money for my service animal pug who is worth every penny.

Like a reviewer before me said, this product is like crack for dogs!  The chews don't leave a mess, they occupy my dog for a couple of minutes, clean his teeth and they get rid of bad breath.  A lot of chews are either messy or leave him with bad breath -- or both.  No digestion problems either, like rawhide can cause.  He did have a problem once with a rawhide chew that got us worried - I presume that's the compressed product related problem that a previous reviewer mentioned.  This never happened with the Greenies as they mostly melt away rather than break off in pieces, unlike rawhide.  As far as I can tell, this is a great product.",5

He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size.

Making a different dish (has to have different protein source and flavoring) every other night is the only way I can keep weight on this once food-frenzied chow hound.  The ONLY consistent item he eats -- including dog treats and human table food -- are Greenies treats.  The ""Senior"" variety is the perfect texture (softer than the regular Greenies treats) for his aging, sensitive teeth.  The inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin to help with his joints give me hope that it helps the creaking and cracking of his joints.  Whatever the formula they use to make it easier to digest is a plus since I know his aging system doesn't work as well in his older years.

Greenies are not a chew that will last very long (usually about 30 seconds with my dogs) - but they do the job.  The chew's consistency is just right for a dental bone.  I give one to each dog after their evening meal, and afterwards there is no food residue left on their teeth.<br /><br />Dental bones aren't the kind of treats that I use frequently or for training.

356104,B002QWP8H0,A74SHV5ZD3RLT,Great product and free shipping to AK.  Can't beat that!,"I thought I would write a review because I have seen some negative ones out there. In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",5

It is also good for Asian style sweet dishes, gives an excellent flavor. If you using it as a dietary supplement by taking a tablespoon; it can be quite difficulty to swallow because of the texture. One thing about this oil is it doesn't refrigerate well and at 76 Fahrenheit it melts completely.",5
367526,B003B3OOPA,AJYPAZ3JBHBKD,Awesome Stuff !!,"This was my first time to try coconut oil, other than using the red kind for popcorn. [which works great in a Stir Crazy] I will be repeating what many have said, but just to add my thoughts....I hope Amazon stocks this FOREVER !!  Smells lovely, like coconut, reminds me of the beach. At room temperature, it is solid....and if I have one tiny complaint, it can be a little difficult to spoon out of the jar. I don't want to soften/melt it each time I need a teaspoonful, so I struggle a bit and scoop it out.<br /><br />  On toast or English muffins, you can use it just like butter, but it seems to have a much more pleasant taste, and leaves the bread more crispy, {never soggy like butter can sometimes pool on toast in little patches.} To use making scrambled eggs or an omelet, it's easy to use, just like any oil, and adds no real discernible taste to me. It's great to just take some and rub on your skin, you then smell wonderful, and it soaks right in....leaving your skin smooth and silky. I have dry skin, and using this coconut oil or almond oil is something that has changed my life....tossing out all the ""off the shelf"" lotions that never really helped.<br /><br />  Only time will tell if all the health benefits pan out for me. But I enjoy using this instead of butter, and plan to continue to do so. The price is great here on Amazon, especially on Subscribe and Save. It was delivered quickly, although it was just tossed into a large box, and allowed to roll around in transit, which I thought was strange packaging. But it was undamaged, and still solid, no evidence of leakage in the box.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try healthier oils, and anyone with dry skin. I read online that this can be mixed with garlic oil and Vit. E liquid to make a healing ointment. There is a lot of info online regarding the positives of coconut oil, and Dr. Oz recommends it, for what that is worth to you.",5

My sister insisted that I ditch all the expensive treatments and commercial products and just let my hair go natural and treat it with coconut oil which she uses on her gorgeous, long, black tresses. In desperation, I ordered several bottles. They came surprisingly fast and I immediately tore open the box and after inhaling the euphoric aroma for a half a minute, I slathered it on my hair and scalp and left it on all day (while indoors). After I washed it off, my hair was visibly silkier, shinier, and had much less breakage. I'm in love! Also, I use it on my skin and it absorbs well and leaves my skin supple with a slight smell of coconut. Love the price, love the product. Can't go wrong.",5

I use the oil for my GI tract since I have several issues with it and have difficulty with handling and absorbing fats.

The first thing I did was try it on my hair. I can't remember if I left a review on the other Coconut oil I bought but I have hair past my waist and I was in my pool on a hot day and when I finally got out I was exhausted.  I wanted to rest before I showered and passed out. I went to sleep with all of that chlorine in my hair and my hair was a dull, brittle feeling. I had just received the oil 2 days before. So I rubbed it through my hair. My hair seemed to be bright and soft. It even looked a little more blond. I have been cutting up veggies and spraying the oil on them while cooking. I bought the ""Misto"" and filled it with the Coconut oil. But the best thing so far...Is toast with the oil on it. There are so many benefits of the Oil and it is delicious.<br />***Here is the EDIT***9-5-12<br />I found a new delicious way to use this. You know the Olive oil bread dipping with garlic? Well, I made spaghetti and I put my seasonings and started to put my olive oil in my round dishes and right then I stopped. I put 2 tbsp of EVOO and 3 tbsp of Coconut oil the grated the garlic and added my Parmesan cheese. OMG, it was so wonderful.<br />Thanks to all of you who inspired me to start using this stuff.",5

I've tried numerous products on her to try to remove the little bumps, but nothing had worked. Almost immediately after applying a very thin layer of coconut oil on her skin, there was an amazing improvement! The bumps lessened, and after a week they had completely disappeared! After seeing these results, I had my son use it, who has eczema on his hands.... and again, the eczema cleared up almost immediately.<br /><br />I personally use the coconut oil on my hands to moisturize them, and also put a tablespoon of the stuff in my coffee every morning to help with my metabolism as I have thyroid issues.",5

She had severe Ezcema and it kept recuring whenever she got hot. her skin in exactly like a baby's skin should be - soft and smooth since I started using it. Plus I'm always smelling her bc she smells so yummy. OFF TOPIC: I also give her lots of pure coconut water and she loves it<br />For me, I spread it on my toast, sprinkle on my salads, saute with it - scrambled eggs are THE BEST when fried with this. I even put a few teaspoons in my hot choclate (yummy). It's the best for retaining moisture in your hair so I also use as a hot oil treatment before bed and wash off next day. I let my hair air dry and it's the softest its been in years. I lather with is right after my shower and wake up with soft supple skin. I keep one in the bathroom, another in the Kitchen and one in my daughter's room.

It not only moisturizer my hair but it makes it really soft and manageable. It also gives my hair shine, body, and luster. Although, I have flakes here and there the amount of dandruff has decreased dramatically, when I use the product consistently.I have even given it a test run by allowing my hair to go without it for about a week.

Avoid the long chain saturated fats (animal fats), but short chain saturated fats (like butter, palm, and coconut) are fine.<br /><br />I love cooking my morning eggs in this oil.  They stick WAY less than cooked in butter or olive oil.  Yes, it imparts a VERY MILD coconut taste to whatever you cook in it.  I don't mind, and have come to like it.  It was different the first few times, tho.  I also recommend you get an aluminum anodized (ceramic non-stick) pan.  Yes, I know they still contain teflon...doesn't bother me (the anodize coating is porous, and the pores are filled with teflon).

It makes a great hot oil treatment in tandem with amla oil.

Im surprised how different it is from Jarrow..It definitely has that more natural taste that the reviews here said. I will never get another brand of coconut oil.",5
367557,B003B3OOPA,A2MPNGP63XMNY0,"Excellent for skin, hair, and cooking","I bought this primarily to use on my hair after using coconut oil in small bottles that I would have to microwave before use because they were solid. This oil is easy to scoop out and it melts in your hands so doesn't need to be continually microwaved. I ran out of anti-wrinkle cream, so I decided to put this oil of my face instead, and it makes it very soft and supple and hopefully it will keep the wrinkles at bay as well. On a whim, I decided to use some while frying rice and it came out absolutely delicious. It gives a hint of coconut flavor to dishes cooked in it. I'm ordering another jar because I don't want to cook with something I'm scooping out to use on my face and hair.  I will be ordering many more jars.",5
367558,B003B3OOPA,A70T8C7VM2ZUW,Very healthy,"Very good quality unrefined coconut oil.  I coom with this and used it to mix with shea butter when i was pregnant for preventing stretch marks and itching and it worked great.  I use it for my baby's ezema now too, its greasy on the skin but soaks in quickly.  When cooking I use it in place of butter and olive oil and it has actually helped with my weight loss and my husbands, of course you have to eat healthy too but it made a noticeable difference in a two week period of time.",5
367559,B003B3OOPA,A149XANF9IAOIN,One of the Best Coconut oils on the Market,"We enjoyed our first 2 jars and use it for cooking an average of 2 times a day. Storage ok so far with our<br />house temp under 76 degrees. During the summer will have to refrigerate it to keep it solid. Great flavor with all meats-beef, fish, chicken; adding to oatmeal.  Too bad the prices are going up everywhere including this product on all Coconut oils sold.  This is the best price for this brand so far.  Will continue to use it unless the price keeps going up.",5
367560,B003B3OOPA,A1PBDKO1I6CINA,Pure and tasty CoconutOil from Amazon,"Mild but definite Coconut flavor here. I use instead of butter on toast, vegies, rice, cakes, etc. Not good for frying, except eggs. No crispy browning. Contains medium chain amino acids that works wonders on brain neuron connections for Alshiemers and weaned  babies. Lack of these, may even be a factor in causing Autism. Olive, and other oils have none. Non-hydrogenated!",5
367561,B003B3OOPA,A2J57JX13BF5CP,Amazing Skin and Hair Softener!,"I use this coconut oil as both a skin oil and a deep conditioner for my hair. It gives me a lovely coconut fragrance, and my skin and hair haven't been this soft in years! I am also going to go out and get a small container so I can carry a bit around in my purse for chapstick. No more dry lips for me! I highly recommend this product to anyone (Well, unless you hate coconut. Then you might not be such a fan of the smell. It is pretty subtle, however, and reminds me of summer :D ).",5
367562,B003B3OOPA,AMC4IYZQ515H4,The smell of sunshine and ice-cream!,"I thought I hated coconut oil, because I bought the cheap, processed Louanna coconut oil from Wally World. It is still sitting in the cupboard with only one use. Later, I read an article and found that to get the benefits of coconut oil you need it unrefined. When I opened the lid the smell of coconut assured me that this oil was the real thing--I love this stuff! I've used it so many different ways; my favourite ways to use are as a sugar scrub or as a deodorant--melt a few tablespoons of oil, put in 1/8 cup baking soda and cornstarch, and a couple drops of tea tree oil.",5
367563,B003B3OOPA,AJLPS4A9HGOQK,Good product,I recently read that coconut oil can be helpful with dementia so I looked for an easy source (as a hopeful preventative!).  This is a very nice product and gives good instructions for using it for cooking and also as a hair treatment.  I certainly recommend it.  And they have a web address on the jar for answering questions.  I contacted them with a question about allergens and they responded quickly.,5
367565,B003B3OOPA,A313E4ZC69N13A,Tastes great and good for you,Coconut oil is so good for you and tasty. It contains 62% MCT (medium chain triglycerides) which is a type of fat that actually helps you burn MORE fat. Easy to cook with and make delicious smoothies with too.,5
367566,B003B3OOPA,AN20622QMIJVV,Absolutely great!!,"I LOVE the organic coconut oil by Nature's Way.  It is the best moisturizer for my face and hair (I have tried almond, shea and grapeseed too), and not to mention, it feels so smooth, creamy and totally awesome on my hands, fingertips and feet.  Also, this is totally natural and cold pressed.  What more can you ask for?  No bad odors either (unlike shea oil)!  I have used the Nutiva organic coconut oil too, and Nature Way just feels a lot better and totally awesome on my hands.  I cannot comment as far as cooking is concerned, because I go through these jars very fast just using them for hair and skincare and scalp message.  I use this and pure almond oil alternatively on my eyelids and under eyes.  Try it by all means, if you are thinking about it.",5
367567,B003B3OOPA,A2RFGRBQ5NZFOP,Delightful taste!,"I'm just starting out with coconut oil, and after trying this product,well, I'm a now believer.  I wasn't sure what I'd gotten myself into when I first tried a spoonful.  The texture reminded me a bit of crisco (uh!), but it immediately started to warm on my tongue and there was a heavenly, light coconut aftertaste that reminded me a bit of an almond joy bar (without the almond or chocolate).  I prefer not to eat it by the spoonful because of the consistency, but really like spreading it on a graham cracker, the taste of which reminds me of coconut cream pie with a graham cracker crust. I also like cooking with it, and didn't notice coconut-tasting chicken. I recently ordered a larger amount of coconut oil and tried a different brand, but I prefer the Nature's Way flavor. I'll use the other brand as a moisturizing cream, and order more of the Nature's Way for eating and cooking. It's wonderful for moisturizing after a shower, or for using right before bed when the coconut scent is restful. This is my favorite brand, and I'm sticking to it.",5
367568,B003B3OOPA,A3V95IASL3W467,Great stuff!,"I use this coconut oil on my hair as a sealant after I moisturize my hair, and I also mix it into my conditioners and oils. I absolutely adore this product! My hair smells absolutely amazing and feels just as good! I recommend buying this, because the results are nothing short of amazing! My hair has never been so soft and smelt so good before!",5
367569,B003B3OOPA,AKSOP2AIIDYOR,Yum!,"I was surprised how large the tub actually was. The coconut oil is in a crisco consistency, but when I bake something with it, I just smear it on the pan, and when I fry something with it, I just drop it in the pan like I would butter. It smells incredible! After cooking with it, I could smell it on me for a few hours after and loved it. I use lots of it when I make coconut chicken, shrimp, etc. I use it to sautee my vegetables too. The coconut taste is not overwhelming, so substituting this healthy option for your regular cooking oil will not ""ruin"" your dishes or significantly change the taste of your food. I will purchase again.",5
367570,B003B3OOPA,A20SZC6WUCLJ2J,"High quality, low cost product","My sister introduced me to coconut oil and although she was weary about me using it as face lotion I showed her that it helped me A LOT with my dry skin and did not cause acne. Normally I have really dry skin on my nose at forehead to the extent that it would start peeling off in the middle of the day... and no lotions would work! :( Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin fairly normal in this regard -- especially with the dry, harsh winters of IL. Any coconut oil would do, but this one is low cost, high quality, has fast shipping. Basically, once this jar runs out, I'm ordering it again.",5
367571,B003B3OOPA,A82Z0WEE3530L,I just got mine and I am so excited!,"It smelled great in the jar. I used it immediately on my pregnant belly, thighs, eyes, and a dry patch under my mouth. I also heated up a tiny bit (a little goes a long way) in the microwave to apply to my hair and ends to freshen up my 3rd day flexi rod set. I can just tell this is my new beauty staple! My cat tried to eat some too and that just goes to show because my smart fat kitty would never try to eat any hair product, but he knew this baby was naturally edible lol.",5
367572,B003B3OOPA,A1FG8UTWU5CVAK,Cleared up my skin!!,"This coconut oil has truly been my little miracle product. I have Keratosis Pilaris and I have tried different products for years trying to get rid of it or improve it even a little, to no avail. I have tried countless lotions, including KP Duty. About a month ago I stumbled upon an article of someone claiming coconut oil cleared up her keratosis, I was skeptical but figured it was worth a shot. I have been applying coconut oil to my skin every time I take a shower and also mixing in about 1/2 a tablespoon with my dinner for about a month now.  I also added a daily multivitamin into my diet. The progress was slow but now all of a sudden my skin has shown incredible improvement. I would say my keratosis has cleared up as much as 75%!  I am shocked and very happy.  Such a cheap alternative to all the expensive lotions too!! I will continue to use Coconut Oil for life.",5
367573,B003B3OOPA,A3CH8DBQR6QGV,So yummy!,I bought this as a suggestion for my very dry and very sensitive skin. I absolutely love it. I used it for the first time and my skin is already 80% better!  It doesn't leave you overly oily either. It smells so yummy as well. Very happy overall!,5
367574,B003B3OOPA,A3KQ4UP6VN5TP1,This stuff is the truth,"Coconut oil. My staple product for hair ,supplements, body lotion. This stuff has my hair growing like wild fire. It works great smell awesome and its the best body oil. My number one thing is coconut oil. Try it.",5
367575,B003B3OOPA,A3MX83L81I5OU0,Love It,This stuff is so great. It smells wonderful and melts like butter in your hands. I love its many different uses. I love it on my hair and skin and soon ill try some of it in my food.,5
367576,B003B3OOPA,A32OKCIVCCEWAD,Interesting Oil,"This is a very unique oil, you can use it in your hair as a hot oil treatment, use it to soothe pain on an infected area on the skin, you can use it when cooking. I like the solid form of this product. No spills, melt what you need. Nice fragrance too.",5
367577,B003B3OOPA,A36EK9QNCTIDYQ,"Love, love, love it","I use it on my skin, but it is eatable.  It melts right away when you spread it on your skin and it smells sooo good.",5
367578,B003B3OOPA,A1BRJC0KMD8DBH,Great,I received this item within a week and I am stationed overseas. I use it on my skin and it makes it soooo soft.,5
367579,B003B3OOPA,A4ELYLTH8W77S,Makes everything taste good...,"You can a little of this with just about anything you bake.  I add this to my baked banana bread and it's great.  I've used it on my hair also, I remember using pure coconut oil when I was a little girl in my home country as a conditioner and hair softener.  This is a good price as I've seen it for a lot more in our local stores.",5
367580,B003B3OOPA,A1UOCDH5CPYQ75,Excellent,"I am from the Philippines, so I am familiar with the smell of fresh coconut oil. I have tried various so-called virgin coconut oils before, but they smelled so rancid within one week of opening, that at one point I resorted to rendering my own coconut oil, but that was so time-consuming and tedious. Some other brands were masked by additional scent. For a while I was discouraged from trying any coconut oil, until I read reviews on this one. I tried one, and I was hooked. It smelled so HEAVENLY like the fresh coconut that I remember. Every time I would apply on my skin or hair, I would be reminded of our rice-based coconut desserts, so for purposes of having a dose of 1-2 tbsp per day, it was also not hard for me to take it plain, although the lack of sweetness quickly brings me back to the reality that it was not coconut-y dessert I was eating, but that's easily solved by adding muscovado or brown sugar. This is certainly the best coconut oil I have had so far, and the ONLY one I have tried and actually finished (I used to stop using those previous ones when I could no longer stomach the rancid smell, which usually brought the content down to only 25%).  This is also the first coconut oil brand that I actually tried to bake with (although it quickly used up my tub). I have subscribed for this to be delivered monthly, but I might change that to a more frequent supply of fresh tubs. After I was truly impressed by it, only then did I check out where it came from, and was surprised to find that it came from my country! Keep up the good work of making available a quality product to the whole world!",5
367583,B003B3OOPA,A3I7WN805F3WZD,Tastes Good And Is Not Expensive,"I don't know if this is making me healthier or not but I have added into my shake on recommendation from my grandmother. It tastes like coconut! I only take a teaspoon a day so I can warm up to it. After about 3 weeks I should be taking a tablespoon or 2. The price is right on this oil.<br /><br />Shake: Amazing Meal Pomegranate-Mango Superfood Powder, frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, Big Train Strawberry Smoothie Mix and Nature's Way coconut oil. This is a thick, thick shake that will fill you up for hours.<br /><br />Update 10/08/12: I have found by far the most efficient and delicious way to get my daily 1 tablespoon. Take 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and heat until it's clear and oily in a dish. Mix in 1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. Stir until the peanut butter is evenly mixed into the oil. Eat on whatever. I have found that if I put large amounts on each bite, it is good sized or a bagel. The coconut oil mellows out the flavor and stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth quality of the peanut butter, so I can eat much more on a bite than if it was just peanut butter. Delicious protein and good fats.",5
367585,B003B3OOPA,A1ADFLDH6ILHIR,It Works,"Gonna make this short and sweet. I use it to *shallow* fry lot's of food. I take it also just as it is when I am feeling lazy and don't feel like eating. After a 4 day juice fast, I started a vegetarian diet, with next to no meat (I currently don't eat meat or eggs, or any dairy products), HIGH plant fats, probably a couple pounds of fruits and veggies every day, and lots of coconut milk. Oh, and lets not forget beans and rice, unprocessed kinds of course. Despite my high fat diet, I am dropping fat weekly. While there may or may not be a profound effect with this oil, I can safely say that it hasn't added any fat. In fact, I am pretty certain that it aids in fat metabolisation. Plus, you get a rare type of MCT with this product, which makes up nearly 70% of the fat contained in the oil.<br /><br />On a side note... DON'T BE AFRAID OF PLANT FATS!! You want to lose weight? Stop eating processed foods (ALL TYPES), eat beans and bulk rice (Wild, Forbidden, Long Grain Brown, Red Rice etc..), nuts/seeds, nutbutter and coconut! Oh, and veggies too of course. Its easy AND CHEAP to eat well. It took me quite some time to be able to figure out how to eat so well on a less than stellar budget, but it can be done! &lt;3",5
367586,B003B3OOPA,A1T3XQ0TPDQIRC,Good for you in every way,"Wow, I'm learning more about natural health products and the how good they are for you.  This Coconut oil is amazing, a gift from God to us.  I used this coconut oil mix with a little baking soda to make homemade deodorant and it works unlike the ones I bought from the natural store.  I use this coconut oil to moisturize my skin, treat my hair, and to nourish my inside by taking a teaspoon a day.  This is heaven sent, and it helps to kill candida and a whole lot of other stuff! Simply put, its just good for you.  This particular brand is better than others I've compared it to.  It has more of the good fat and it tastes better.  5 thumbs up for EfaGold, and the price on amazon is fabulous too!",5
367587,B003B3OOPA,AXYZGSH1C0X73,LOVE IT,"so I'm a college student who has been trying to learn how to live a much healthier life in the mist of crazy assignments and packed schedules. I bought this back in January originally for my hair since I'm an African American woman with 3c/4a natural hair. and while it has done WONDERS growing my hair, I've been even more amazed by its other talents. If you use it as an occasional moisturizer it will leave you skin sooooooo soft. I also use it now as a substtute of oil/butter when I'm using my frying pan. You can hardly taste it, and when you do it doesn't taste bad at all. And it works better than oil and butter in my opinion. I'm not a chef but it seems to still burn a little bit when you use oil or butter. With this coconut oil, i just pour a dime size in the pan and use a paper towel to distribute it evenly so it give it a nice gloss. I let it heat for just a few seconds, add my food, and then wa la! no burning, and no more unnecessary calories. I will credit it (along with my diet and exercise) for allowing me to lose 30 pounds this summer. WOOH!",5

It is not only good for you, it has a wonderful flavor in low temp cooking(from eggs to oatmeal), used as a spread, in morning smoothies(adds a crunch as well because it hardens when cooled) and in baking!  Amazon has the best price consistently and Natures  is the best product.  I have it on my auto ship program and love it!",5

You can use it as a lotion after bathing, put in your hair, roll it around in your mouth to collect bacteria (spit it out after 2 minutes) cook with it, shine your shoes with it but the very best is it makes your face feel wonderful all day.  It is by far the best night/day cream and it absorbs quickly so there is no greasy feel.  Love it!!!",5
367591,B003B3OOPA,A2JLKVQYDTEKZZ,Love this!,"I purchased this to use in place of chemical-filled skin lotions.  I had developed some allergic reactions to some items in man-made lotions and my naturopath recommended using organic coconut oil instead.  I LOVE this oil.  It has a light coconut smell that does not linger too long.  I use this all over including on my face and my skin has been more moist (no longer do my legs get dry looking), my face less oily and with fewer blemishes.  My husband has noted that my skin looks younger and fresher.  It DOES take a while to soak in so I have had to adjust my routine a bit to avoid getting oil on things but have yet to stain any clothing or other items.  I tried a couple brands I found at the store prior to ordering this after reading the reviews and have found the brand I will remain loyal to in Nature's Way Effagold.<br /><br />I have also used this in cooking and love the light coconut taste it adds to food.  I still use EVOO for certain things as the taste just compliments certain foods better, but this oil has definitely been added to the diet and is in the rotation.",5

Coming from the land of coconuts, I found this to be a superior product similar to what we get there - a high quality.  Some refined oils have a heady aroma which gets ""cooked"" out.  This one retains its aroma even after cooking. I have used it for sauteing, pan-frying and seasoning with no flavor loss.  Tastes even delicious when raw.

I previously used the Spectrum Naturals brand from a local grocery chain, but gave this one a try because it was a little less expensive. This coconut oil is far better in my opinion. It smells great in the jar, and smells AMAZING when cooking. I've used it for almost every meal I've needed oil for since getting it: browning meat, making crepes, even homemade marinades. When cooking a recipe with many ingredients the flavor tends to get lost, but for less complex meals (like lime shrimp I sauteed last week) you could taste a hint of coconut in the meal. What a fantastic addition! So far everyone, even our kids, has had nothing but rave reviews about it.<br /><br />It's summer and very warm here, so when we got our first jar it was completely liquid. It was a surprise to me, because every jar I'd bought at the store was always like a thick white paste. No worries; if that bothers you, just put in the fridge and it'll harden right up.",5

I have ordered coconut oil in the past, but it did not smell like coconut. This product actually smells like coconut. I love the smell.

I use this in my coffee, fry eggs in it, saute spinach in it, as well as enjoy a tablespoon of it before my workouts. I have read that there are non-food related things you can do with this as well (good for skin, etc) but I have only experienced it through a culinary lens.",5

I have 4a hair in lower back length locks and absorbtion is something that is a must for anything i use in my hair.I am excited to continue using it and I also have used it on my skin. I absorbs well to the skin too leaving my skin supple but not greesy.<br /><br />If you dont like the smell of coconut it may not be the product for you.

It's really delish. I hope all the health claims I read are true! Start slow, though. The first week I had a lot of diarrhea.

My A1C in February was 9.7 the most recent A1C is now 7 which is almost normal. So even though I was also taking my medication, the addition of the coconut oil was the miracle in my book. I have signed up for subscribe and save and will be using the coconut oil with a shipment monthly. I was hesitant at what the results would be as I have tried other things, but it works. Used it on a skin rash as soon as it started and within two days it was gone. Try it for yourself.",5

(Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste! I love coconut so I was able to eat it right from the jar, but I also tried it spread on a Wasa Crisp bread--WOW, what an easy way to get MCFAs into your diet!

367628,B003B3OOPA,A2SA6LR78V49UV,Amazing Stuff!,"We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.<br /><br />We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.<br /><br />Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.<br /><br />Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.",5

I have to honestly admit that she was right!  I only get a pedicure for the pampering every couple of months no longer the necessity and because of the results I apply the coconut oil to my entire body after the bath and I can't believe the difference in my skin's texture.  It's unbelievable.  The only thing about this one is during the summer months you have to find a cool place in the house to keep this such as underneath the bathroom cabinet or in the linen closet because it will liquify.  As a mattef of fact I keep it in my bedroom during showering so the steam from the shower won't won't liquify it because once it liquifies it will eventually reharden at room temperature but the consistency changes which to me also changes the chemical structure in it or something because it just doesn't moisturize the same afterwards.

I am afro Caribbean with wavy hair opposed to super kinky hair but my hair gets really dry if I leave it out(wash n set style). But this is great for those using protective styling and for the swimmers like myself. It keeps my hair moist and doesn't weigh it down and my skin look great as well. People don't realize that the chlorine in our shower/water systems here in the states is very drying on our hair and bodies. I'm just glad I got a product that 100% natural and from a vendor who I can trust. I've been ripped off by buying hair products at walmart and supply stores. I live in a predominantly white neighborhood and it is very hard finding things that work for my hair. So, I have to go to neighborhoods out of my way or shop online. And after finding out I bought conditioner that was mixed with bleach (clorox) from an online store that turned my hair into straw/ash it can be very frustrating. So I had to cut off my hair about 5 inches and I'm re-growing it. I had to file a claim with the business bureau and everything.

Instead of taking the recommended ""liptor, et al"", and as a registered nurse who knows the awful side effects of such drugs, I opted to research all things diet related.  After my studies, I have decided that our government and medical community has been either ignorant, at best, or complicit, at worst, in the great soybean growers maligning of the health benefits of this oil.  There are a few good scientific books available through Amazon.  I'm not due for another lipid test for at least a year.  I will post an update here, good or bad outcome.<br /><br />Whole Foods stopped carrying this brand.  I tried their new 365 brand and had to spit it out --- TOTAL PLASTIC TASTE AND SMELL.  This product is in a non-leaching plastic container and is incredibly pleasant tasting raw (only do that after eating anything sweetened with sugar or honey to prevent cavities), but unbelievably delicious in cooking.  Last week I was in an interview and the lady turned and smiled stating she detected a ""slight, delightful hint of just-baked cookies"" coming from my direction.

I am trying to eat healthier and find better alternatives to eating organic as well as preserve the taste of food, or even better, make it tastier.  Although it has been just a bit challenging to eat organic and also consume healthy, tasty products, this has made cutting fast foods completely out TOTALLY WORTH IT. I cannot believe I have never cooked with coconut oil before.  I used it with my ordinary seafood dish and popcorn butter substitute.  It melts immediately and adds a crisp to whatever savory dish you are making.  The faint, but identifiable taste of coconut oil makes the dish even BETTER.  SERIOUSLY, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?  With all the positive reviews, purchasing an item for the first time can be a tiny, wee bit difficult for a newbie.  However, if you are planning to eat healthy and use better cooking alternative oils and saturate your food with a bit more fat (good fat), use coconut oil.  Since this was the brand and product that immediately popped up when I was looking for coconut oil, I will say this is a very high quality and yummmmmmy item to purchase.  I will definitely incorporate more coconut oil in most of all my dishes as I cook many of meals.  Although I have not yet cooked a sweet dish using coconut oil, I am assuming it will be quite delicious as well.  I still cannot get over how additionally tasty my food is with this new additional to my cooking ingredient cart.

I will say - I'm not sure if I buy into the whole coconut oil pulling ""thing"", but anything's worth a shot!  I found that it's best (for me) to put a glob of the oil UNDER my tounge to melt.  Just sticking a glob in my mouth on top of my tounge made me want to barf.  After it melts under my tounge, I can swish it - and the taste is very subtle.  It almost feels like I'm just swishing saliva around.<br /><br />I also decided to start incorporating this oil into my morning cup of coffee as I've seen other reviews mention.  It doesn't really add any taste, but is an easy way to get this in my body - also moisturizes my lips as I drink it!

I use it to take off makeup, as a moisturizer, as a conditioner, and as a cooking oil!<br /><br />As a makeup remover, I use it on dry skin and rub the oil in for around a minute. Then using a warm/hot towel, I let the towel sit on my face until cool. I repeat the process with the towel 2-3 times (depending on how much makeup I have on) and then in slow, circular motions, I rub the makeup off with my towel. It takes off all my makeup, my waterproof mascara, and my sunblock. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped of oil.<br /><br />As a moisturizer, I use it only at night (too oily to use in the morning), after my toner and green cream. I take a little bit and warm it in the palm of my hand. I rub it into my dry spots (which have sometimes crop up due to my use of green cream) and follow up with a cream-based moisturizer to seal it in. I put a bit around my eyes and some on my eyelashes and eyebrows. In the morning, my skin looks plump and remarkably fresh! I love it!<br /><br />As a conditioner, I place a little bit of it in damp hair and leave it in overnight. After washing, my hair (which has been permed, colored, bleached, and ironed to hell and back) feels soft and conditioned!!<br /><br />As a cooking oil, I just use it like I would use olive oil or any other cooking oil. There have been claims that this oil will help with weight loss, but I haven't really noticed any of that. I use it mainly because it smells delicious!!

Coconut oil's praises are long overdue! We used to buy more expensive coconut oil; but these are tough economic times, so we've been using cheap coconut oil. I read all the great reviews on this site and can't believe that for the cheap price, it's organic AND cold-pressed/hexane-free. We've got another brand of what I'd loosely dub coconut oil sitting in the cabinet next to this brand, and although they are similar in price, that's where the similarities end. That stuff is going in the garbage where it belongs. I could barely even taste coconut when using it. I won't go back.<br /><br />I eat about 3 tbsp of this stuff per day and, naturally, it's satisfying. As soon as you open the jar, you can smell the coconut. And the taste...delicious! If you're already a fan of coconut oil and are aware of its healthy properties, try this brand. You won't be sad that you did. And if you're just learning about its merits, this coconut oil is perfect to start using. If you don't like it, you haven't really lost much money.

At that point, the ends become terribly brittle & eventually fray. However, that's no longer a problem since I started using coconut oil as a deep conditioner. The jar says to apply 1-2 hours before washing your hair, but it's obviously better if you leave it in longer. After one use (overnight), my split ends were substantially reduced, all the strands felt smooth from root to tip, & my waves were at their bounciest! Not only is it the most effective solution I've come across, it's also natural & the cheapest.<br /><br />I can't really comment on its other curative properties aside from skincare. I would advise against it in favor of jojoba oil. Coconut oil is heavier & may clog pores. However, it doesn't deserve to get knocked for that considering how well it works on hair.<br /><br />Also, the oil will congeal if it gets in the low 70s. Don't freak out, it's still good & less messy to apply since you can get a good amount on your fingers. If you can't get down like that, just put it in hot water & it will return to its liquid state. Oh, and be careful if you intend to take it as a supplement. You have to ease your body into it & only take a little at a time, like if you're trying to build an immunity to arsenic. Unknowingly, I took the recommended amount (jar, I trusted you!) & proceeded to have my insides torn apart.<br /><br />So, if you can remember these tips, you'll be well on your way to beautiful hair!",5

I am not certain about the usage on my face though - my skin started feeling a bit dry after a few applications at night. So I am still looking into that. All in all it is a good product for a good price!",5
367666,B003B3OOPA,A34LMXTTEVG0IB,Great Stuff!,I love this stuff! I have 4c natural hair and this coconut oil penetrated and moisturized my hair like nobodies business. I've had this since August 2010 and I'm just now purchasing another one so it will take you far.,5
367667,B003B3OOPA,A1DFL66IDY0Z2Z,Outstanding and Delicious,"I ordered on January 9th and received it on January 11th.  Amazing : )<br />I've never purchased or used Coconut Oil - organic or otherwise - but I've been checking out some of it's health benefits.  After reading the positive reviews and seeing the great low price, I had to try it.<br /> I've been battling dry mouth and thought I'd coat my tongue and gums before I go to bed.  Maybe it will help ""seal in"" the moisture.  Who knows.  If it doesn't, it's a delicious mistake.  It's REALLY YUMMY!<br />I'd definitely recommend it -",5
367668,B003B3OOPA,A1JS8ZO023Z0FU,Love it!,"EFAGold Coconut Oil is wonderful. I use this product in my hair to seal in moisture (love it). A little goes a long way, so be very light-handed if using in the hair. The shipment was quick I have no complaints!",5
367669,B003B3OOPA,ADD6MQGCGFGJF,Great Product,"Great product, tastes great. I mixed this with some banana cream pudding and it was heavenly. The coconut flavor and smell it gives is incredible. I also add 2 tblsp to my green tea with honey and it gives my tea that extra yum factor. Will be reordering this product and i am currently actively trying out new recipes for this. I bought 2-16 oz jars, but i can quickly see that will not be enough as i will be using it on skin and hair. This is the real deal, it is not the refined oil you find in grocery stores. Refined vs Unrefined, i'll go with unrefined.",5
367671,B003B3OOPA,A352LCJTFJ4SGI,awesome product!,"If you want soft skin, shiny hair, strong bones, good digestion and something that tastes great, you will want to buy this!  And, as a side benefit, I have lost 4 lbs in just two weeks by eating 1 tbsp a half hour before meals.",5
367673,B003B3OOPA,A3CMEBXKK9SUWA,DELICIOUS,"I've had this product for a total of 48 hours and I'm raving about it already, it tastes AMAZING you can literally not go wrong with this product. Don't like the results on your hair? Try it on that dry patch of skin you have. Not healing it quick enough? Put it on a piece of toast. Coconut flavor too strong? Bake with it as a substitute for other butters/oils in recipes. And statistically, how can one person not be happy with at least one of these options that coconut oil offers? Honestly, this is the smartest purchase I have ever made, I will never go back to putting butter on toast, the coconut flavor is absolutely delicious. The texture is much lighter and it just smells so.amazingly.GOOD. I love how the subtle taste infused into my sunny side up egg, and although I haven't tried it in other foods yet, I'm REALLY looking forward to doing so IMMEDIATELY!!",5
367674,B003B3OOPA,AC34TPWTVKUJB,Lowered my triglycerides,Who knew coconut oil lowers cholesteral? We added one tablespoon per day. Fasting cholesterol test show it cut my trigliceride number in half.,5

It brought my blood pressure down from 150/80 to 126/62. My skin soaks it up and looks younger. I eat it with my meals. It has a mild, pleasant coconut taste. It is doing many good things internally that Iam not even aware of.",5

Anyway, both myself and the squirrels love it!  It tastes great just on its own...I'm looking forward to trying it as a spread on whole wheat bread.  I recommend this product very highly...it's delicious!",5
367680,B003B3OOPA,A10MBPTTQA249A,EXCELLENT Hair Conditioner - Blonde Hair,"I LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR!  I am caucasian with blonde highlighted hair. My hair strands are fine but I do have a lot of hair and it is relatively long. My scalp is also naturally a little oily. My hair is healthy, but I do need deep conditioning though as I expose my hair to a lot of elements. (I give all of this detail in case someone is making the decision for themselves as identifies with my hair profile.)<br /><br />My Hubby is a hairdresser / salon owner and because of this I get to try all kinds of hair products.  I've even had expensive caviar shampoo and conditioner (As I roll my eyes). I've used other oils in my hair and most require several washings to get the oil out.  Not this Coconut Oil.  I put it on my dry hair at night and wrap a satin wrapping cap around it while I sleep.  (available near the relaxer s in the hair care section of the store) When I wake I shampoo an condition like normal and my hair looks amazing! I use it twice a week now!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Nothing and I mean nothing has made my hair feel as silky and look as shiny as this Coconut Oil.<br /><br />The oil starts out think like crisco but melts in your hands when rubbed together quickly.  This consistency makes it super easy to apply.<br /><br />It isn't runny or drippy.<br /><br />Amazingly ""repairs"" hair after too much sun, surf, chlorine etc.<br /><br />When washed it does not leave a fragrance behind.<br /><br />No Chemicals! 100% Organic and good for you!<br /><br />THE TRICKY<br /><br />It smell of the coconut is rich and luscious and I love it -  but it was hard to ignore it when I woke up or turned over in the night.  It only took about two applications though for me to get used to it.",5

I ate some of this with coconut cookies and couldn't stop until I accepted that it is oil... so I can't be eating insane amounts of it. Very nice that it has good fats in it as well. I used a bit as  moisturizer for my face after it was quite dry and my face was supppppppper hydrated and moist after, so make sure you barely put as much as the size of this 'O' on your finger tip.",5

I found this to be a great moisturizer for both skin and hair, and it smells wonderful.  Both my young nieces use it for their skin and also love it.  One of my nieces thinks it smells like pound cake!  It is an oil though, so it's hard to use as a moisturizer right out of the jar, so I put it in a spray bottle.  Much better.  I recommend this for a good moisturizer.",5

I use this as a skin moisturizer, hair deep conditioner, I sometimes eat a spoon from my fridge stack ( cuz it does taste good.) I love the smell  too. I even use it as a makeup remover and I use it as a lip balm mixed with Shea butter lips feels so smooth. I have people complement me on my skin tone and how smooth my skin is. I don't tell too many people about it because those who are not aware of any oil benefit automatically assumes its like corn oil or any other cooking oil and are put off by it.  Not me I've read plenty about it and I am never going without it again.  I haven't used used another brand of coconut oil but I will say that the best type is cold compressed coconut oil and organic extra virgin.",5

I use it to make my toothpaste, as a moisturizer and a little bit in my hair. I also use it on my dogs dry skin. It's really great for your underarms because of the antibacterial properties it has.

A friend introduced me to Nature's Way Coconut Oil and I fell in love. I mix it with my regular body lotion before applying it. My skin stays moisturized, feels baby soft, and does not feel oily. I have a problem with fragrances in general, and was at first worried about smelling like a coconut. However, that is not a problem at all; there is no scent. I've ordered this product twice so far and will continue to do so.",5

I thought I would give it a try when I bought a Whirley Pop.  This is so very good with making popcorn ... I add a little bit of butter too.  I was pleasantly surprised at the smell and how good this taste.  I even eat small amounts right out of the jar.  I must say, not all coconut oil is the same.  I ran out so I bought more coconut oil at a local grocery store.  It is not the same, I am so disappointed.  The aroma isn't there.  I should have never wasted my money, and just came here to order more.",5

I use it for cooking to replace all other oils i used to use. I use it as a body lotion. I use it as a deep conditioner for my hair before getting in the shower. I mix it with baking soda to make a natural deodorant (that works every bit as good, if not better than anything you'd buy at the store.) It works as a massage oil. Basically, it's a miracle product that is useful in so many ways and is sooo good for you.",5
367697,B003B3OOPA,A1QELVOWJKCHE2,Organic and Multi-Purpose,Extremely good product and versatile. I like Nature's Way and this is just another product I use daily. I use it for cooking and as a skincare product! Two for the price of one.,5

Gives it an excellent flavor- so much better than butter. And healthier. My puppy loves coconut oil too. Anytime I am in the bathroom conditioning my hair with it she will run in and beg for a bite.

It works great on my hair when I put it in and let it stay overnight and wash it out in the morning, hair is healthier and doesn't break off.<br />It's great for my face and a lot better than the otc acne medication, the only thing about it is I can't put it on EVERY night or it'll redden and irritate my face. Every other night seems to work fine though.<br />And it's delicious and really helps with weight loss when eaten in very small amounts.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of this stuff and would recommend it to everyone.",5

It's softer, and not just on the surface -- it feels healthier deep down and the tone is more even. I use it on my face as well. I prefer natural products, so I read up on the benefits of virgin coconut oil and then checked out the reviews here on Amazon.

It's fantastic.  I truly enjoy it.",5

367734,B003B3OOPA,A2DOLTLPCJ2XQ6,Good Stuff!,I love this stuff.  I go through it so fast.  This is my favorite brand.  I like it better than Nutiva texture.  There are no particles in it.  Nutiva has small particles which is supposed to be completely normal and their may even been some benefits to it but I just prefer it without them. I absolutely HATE coconuts because of the texture so that is probably why it bothers me.Nutiva is still a good brand but this is better!,5

After doing a bit of research, I chose this product in particular due to the description, reviews, pricepoint, and the fact that it is a brand I have seen in many stores and am familiar with.<br /><br />The non-processed nature of this oil meets my skincare and haircare needs, but also makes it perfect for cooking as well. I bought it to use in the shower but now I cannot stop eating it on everything! It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and flavor, which is clearly natural and not from any artificial colorings or flavors. This is the best brand of coconut oil I have ever bought and it blends into my skin quickly and softly without feeling overly oily, tastes amazing, and washes out of my hair easily.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is packaged in a plastic container. While I am not too worried about the plastic leaching chemicals into the oil itself, I will be buying this product for the rest of my life and I'm sure I will be accumulating a lot of these plastic jars! Though they're recyclable, a glass jar would get reused immediately in my house. Other than that, I am perfectly pleased with this product! For the price, this can't be beat, it's worth spending the ~$10 to try it.<br /><br />Note: I couldn't find where this coconut product was harvested from on Amazon or the EfaGold website, but the bottle itself says it's a product of the Phillipines.",5

My skin felt so wonderful, I had to try it for myself!  She recommended just getting coconut oil.  I actually really like that it solidifies so that I can just rub a little in my palms to heat it and apply it to my face & body.  It does feel a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely and my skin has never felt or looked better.  (I'm also using diluted apple cider vinegar as an astringent.)<br /><br />Now I need to try some of the other uses for coconut oil!",5
367739,B003B3OOPA,A1ZG9C6VXGBK6M,Great moisturizer for hair and skin!,I love this product It is a great moisturizer for my hair as well as my skin. The smell is subtle but pleasing.

She told me she uses it on her hair and it worked wonders.  So after researching it's benefits on the internet I decided to purchase some.  This brand had the best reviews.  I used it as a leave in conditioner on my transistioning hair (I'm afro american) and it gave me a new head of soft hair!  My hair was damaged from dying my hair after a relaxer and it started breaking and shedding extremly bad.  After using the coconut oil one time my hair is moisturized all the way to my ends, no shedding, shiny, non greasy, and just plain beautiful.  I've also decided to use it in cooking too.  I HIGHLY recommend trying some, you won't regret it!! And it tastes and smells wonderful!!",5

367742,B003B3OOPA,A2D11SCG19NFTT,This is an awesome product,I only cook with this coconut oil.  It's wonderful and adds a delightful taste to veges.  I fry eggs in it. I fry steaks in it.  I saute veges in it. It's yummy and keeps perfectly on your kitchen counter.  It does not have to be refrigerated.  I will not be without this stuff in my kitchen.,5
367744,B003B3OOPA,A1HS55TIAPZP4C,Love this EVCO!,"I love organic coconut oil and feel it is a must in our diet. I just couldn't stomach the $16 price tag from Whole Foods anymore for the exact same product. I received it today, it has the exact same exp date on the package (I know that is an issue with some items on Amazon, products being too close to the exp date and maybe that is why you got it at a bargain price).<br />Came well packaged with the seal intact, no problems. I will buy it again from this seller. And with Amazon Prime, it makes it a super bargain!<br />Also, if you are doing your research on the many amazing properties coconut oil possesses, you know that it is anti-bacterial. I discovered almost 3 yrs ago that I was allergic to antiperspirant/deo. My armpits would itch and I would scratch them almost raw. When I stopped using anti/deo, the itch stopped. Looking around online, this happens to many people. What to do? Well, I went to Whole Foods and bought plenty of natural deos that did not work AT ALL! Good for me they take back anything, including used deo. I researched and found a recipe for coconut oil deo. It has cornstarch, baking soda, and coconut oil. I followed a recipe, (google coconut oil deodorant recipe) formed it into an old deo container, and what do you know? It works like a charm! NO ODOR! It does not stop sweat, but guess what folks? You are supposed to sweat under your armpits, it is your body's way of detoxifying itself. Sweat smells when the bacteria from the skin and the perspiration meet in a dark, warm place- the armpit. The EVCO inhibits the production of bacteria. You have a serious amount of lymph nodes there that need the freedom to move toxins out of your body. And we wonder why women get breast cancer more and more these days. When I have important social events or meeting I use a regular antiperspirant, but 90% of the time I use this. Keep in fridge in warmer climates, it melts at 76 degrees F.<br /><br />Coconut oil is truly amazing stuff, give it a try. Can't hurt.",5
367745,B003B3OOPA,A9J7HZRFLDGHO,Best all around,"i eat it, use it in my hair, and use as a moisturizer. My skin seems smoother and wrinkles seem less noticeable.  I have extremely dry skin and this does not break me out.  My bf has really oily skin and it works great on him as well!  This coconut oil is amazing!!",5
367746,B003B3OOPA,A22IQ8J47JT0D1,After shower skin softener,"Right after showering, put a dab in palm. It starts to melt and then rub it in feet, legs, elbows, tops of hands...It is amazing. Real lasting moisturizing skin softener. And all natural. Smells great too.",5
367747,B003B3OOPA,A26C4ERZO1QL1N,Great taste & perfect body lotion!,"This coconut oil is perfect for the cost.  Extra virgin? check! Organic? check! Unrefined, cold-pressed? check! So many uses, cooking, skin care, hair care, etc.",5
367748,B003B3OOPA,A2Z5MGANGJKLBV,Great Quality & nice price,I can not get EXtra virgin coconut oil around here. my stores simply do not carry it expect for the nutrician places which are high priced. I had tonsillitis and this was receommend on soothing the iratation involved. It worked wonderfully. the taste was good and the price was very reasonable for my area. Thank you,5
367749,B003B3OOPA,A2IGL5EC3SOWVD,I love it!!!,"It worked wonders on myhair! Its good right off the spoon, my dogs love it on their crunchy food that before they never wanted to eat! I also add it in my oatmeal. Also works wonders for feet massages! So many uses, went thru a whole bottle in probably 2 weeks because I love it so much!",5
367750,B003B3OOPA,A2K9O90NDDKYHF,Divine,"This Coconut Oil product is nothing short of amazing! It makes a delicious body moisturizer, a flavour enhancer over breakfast cerea or in hot chocolate for a ""coconutty"" flavour. Highly recommended.",5
367751,B003B3OOPA,A397DYAUTOVBVB,I enjoy the many uses of this product,I love coconut oil for everything. There are so many use for this. I use it for a hair and skin conditioner. I cook with it as a healthy oil not for flavor. It doesn't really have flavor. I love that it is organic and extra virgin. It was shipped promptly and it did not leak at all. It has a safety seal on it so it can't leak unless it was already opened or perhaps busted. I add this to my smoothies. It helps keep you regular if you use it on a daily basis. I will be ordeering this again. I like what this product do for me. I am on a weight management program and I use this as one of my tools to help me. You do not need to refrigerate this unless you want it solid. I store mine in the cabinet I don't mind it being an oil form.,5
367752,B003B3OOPA,A3A2ZQ4HZFEJ3T,"Smells good, tastes good, moisturizes good","I've both cooked with this and used it as lotion and it has been exactly what I was looking for in both.  I've also used it as a leather conditioner treatment on my saddle and boots and it worked great for that as well.  It has a great nutty type of smell, I was concerned that when I cooked with it, it would be over powering but it wasn't.",5
367753,B003B3OOPA,ALL20IS3DUW02,Love it.,I love coconut oil i use it for everything its so moisturizing and it has so many uses only around for me was the packaging coconut oil is in solid form but melts when heated so it should have been a zip lock or something since it did leak all over the box other then that love it.,5
367754,B003B3OOPA,A1OF61ZUIODK4,"Love, love, love.....","I love, love, love this product. The other coconut oil that I bought at a local super market taste like lard....yuck. This is creamy and a coconut lovers dream. If you want good tasting food and a great looking body and skin, get this product!!! You really can't go wrong!!!",5
367755,B003B3OOPA,A21XISGVL7C6RM,Multi-use Product,"Great price if you suscribe. I use this product for cooking. It adds a light coconut flavor to less flavorful foods, like tofu. I also use it  on my skin, and I use it on my hair. It is a good moisturizer and does not leave my skin or my hair greasy. It is quite the versatile product. I have not seen all the benefits touted by advocates of coconut oil, but I've only been using the product for a month. I would  recommend this product for anyone wanting to try coconut oil.",5
367756,B003B3OOPA,A3ATVX4GHV8L88,Coconut Oil is Great!,"I didn't know what to expect from this product.  Others speak of using it on their hair, skin, & etc...I chose to use it for cooking.  This Coconut Oil has to be the cleanest tasting, delicious product I have ever used to fry with.  I cannot eat foods that have a lot of grease, so this product is perfect for me.  It does not taste oily at all & the taste of your foods come through, not like other cooking oils.  I will absolutely continue to purchase more.",5
367758,B003B3OOPA,AU7TT24FR2XC7,First try with virgin coconut oil,"I recently started with the coconut oil.  I tried the Louana product I got at the local Kroger.  No flavor, but it was a start.  After reading the various reviews, I thought I'd try this since this seemed such a reasonable price.<br />I am quite happy with it.  The coconut taste is fine and definitely different than the Louana, so I mixed the two to make it go further and make the Louana more flavorful and economize my use of coconut oil.",5
367760,B003B3OOPA,A1390WQJ54J8SH,Surprised by the coconut flavor!,"This is a great product just as all of the other reviewers have stated.  Much to my surprise, this tastes so much better than the other coconut oil that I bought regularly before.  This one has a much more coconutty taste.  Plus this one is Extra Virgin so it is healthier than the Expeller pressed that I used to buy.  Better price and better quality.  I love this coconut oil.",5
367761,B003B3OOPA,A1FEHPW4GT6WS6,coconut oil,The coconut oil works great on my hair and skin. my hair responded great to the oil and it grew a little because of the oil.,5
367762,B003B3OOPA,A3NKEKNSSMC765,Great purchase,"I'm taking this product since last week (just 5 days until now) and will see the results soon. The flavor is good and the quality too, the delivery was ok.",5

367765,B003B3OOPA,A88AUME6TSUK7,Great product,"I love this product. I bake with it and use it on my skin.  I have always had an issue with dry skin, but the Coconut Oil keeps my skin moisture all day. I especially love it on my natural hair, no more dry scalp. I have recommended this to most of my friends. Will buy more in the future.",5
367767,B003B3OOPA,A2CHWR128F31M5,Great for smoothies!!,"I bought this and another brand to try and both are equally as good.  I do like the clear container that this comes in though better so this is the brand I will stick with.  It comes in a clear plastic container and I don't notice any plastic taste as others have commented on coconut oil in general.  I just put a big spoonful in my magic bullet when I make smoothies!  So yummy!!  You can eat this straight out of the jar if you want to also.  It is good!  When I first got it (shipped in the winter), it was pretty firm and I had to scrape it with a spoon to get it out..like candle wax.  But once it warmed up a bit..just room temperature, it is very soft now.  It still is a solid though, but easier to work with.  It is similar to the inside of an Almond Joy candy bar at room temp.  I can't comment on health affects since I am a relatively healthy person with bloodwork that shows great results..so far, but am only 34 yrs old.  I love coconut and hope it can help with brain function, memory mostly..lol.  I hope if I start taking it now, it will help long term. Once I run out, I will be getting the largest jar for my money!  My husband and kids love the smoothies made with this! It's not overpowering either..just the perfect hint of coconut among the other fruit and veggies. I made mango, pineapple, banana, and coconut smoothies that were just awesome!! Even all blended up well, you can still see the tiny white coconut flakes within the smoothies. Just yummy!!",5
367768,B003B3OOPA,AKA4AA8Y669BN,the best I have tried,"I use this coconut oil for cooking, face cream and as a nutritional supplement.<br />The quality is extraordinary! Once you try this you will not want any other coconut oil.",5
367769,B003B3OOPA,A1026Z3HI9IC0S,great coconut oil,"this is a great product. excellent taste. great price and value. if you're looking for coconut oil to add MCT's to your diet, this is a great option.",5
367770,B003B3OOPA,A1KUNNBCC6WHST,Great for hair and skin,I use this on my hair and on my skin after my bath or shower.  It is light so it doesn't weigh down your hair and gives your skin the moisture it needs without being greasy.  I've seen a big difference in my skin and my hair since using this over the last 4 months. Great product!,5
367771,B003B3OOPA,A3AE1W3TAB5QRJ,Fantastic,"I love this product. I love the smell, the taste and the way I feel when I use this product. I try to use it in every way possible. I put it in my oatmeal for a satisfying,longlasting hunger satisfier. I also spread it on toast instead of butter. Yummy, what a treat and so healthy!",5
367772,B003B3OOPA,AQXCBBWLZ5MS7,Love this,"We use this in place of a lotion for our 5 month old.  It is light, very moisturizing an has a subtle coconut smell, which is something that was missing from the last kind we tried.",5
367775,B003B3OOPA,A11SG9BYL6BMU8,Life saver !!,"I am so happy I found this product, I actually just ran out of my coconut oil that I ordered from a online site, so I was looking for something I could get my hands onto all the time. Great smell, and plenty to last me. Im natural, with a 4c hair type and this is the best for my hair along with other carrier oils or alone! Great plus that I got to use the free trial of amazon prime!! I will be buying this product again.",5
367776,B003B3OOPA,A21WKOJJTE89IB,Awesome stuff,"This is so wonderful that I have to put it on the saver program with Amazon.  I use this for everything, from cooking to putting it on right after the shower to putting it in mine and my children's hair before I condition wash our hair.  I even put it in my Chai tea and it's wonderful on toast, infact it's so great that I don't need any other type of spread like mayo or anything, it's absolutely delicious.  My youngest doesn't like the smell but what does she know, she's only 9, everyone else in the house loves it.  My first jar lasted about a month, but I had to split some of it up so I'd have some in the bathroom and the rest in the kitchen.  I like that it doesn't liquify until you put in on your skin, it only liquified once(it was over 75 degress where I had it) and I put in the frig, however; when I took it out it was too hard.  You'll be very happy when you purchase this and needless to say it came very quickly, I'm on the prime membership so I rec'd it in 2 days.  I love it so much that I'm having a fit because I ran out. Just another note for this (3/12) this stuff cleared up my eczema, I mean it's gone and my skin glows.",5
367777,B003B3OOPA,A2VLKG56H31VUT,"WONDERFUL FLAVOR, SMELL AND CONSISTENCY",I had come across compelling reasons online to add this to my daily nutritional supplements so I bought this product and I have to tell you before I opened the jar I was skedish about downing a tablespoon of this stuff so I first added it to my oatmeal and it actually enhanced the flavor.  My next move was to allow it to liquefy and then I downed a tablespoon of it right out of the jar and I was delighted how wonderful it tasted.,5
367778,B003B3OOPA,A3BZBYHXTKDPKW,Great inside and out!!,"Simply put, I LOVE this stuff! I originally purchased it to replace butter in the kitchen. When I broke it open I was taken in by the smell...it was amazing. I was a little concerned because it smelled kinda sweet, so I wasn't certain if it would alter the taste of my savory dishes. It made them taste better than butter ever did! After doing a little more research I found there are SOOOO many other beneficial uses. So, I have taken to using it on my hair and skin. In fact, I had a little eczema episode on my wrist that the coconut oil healed in less than a week and it has not returned. Highly recommended.",5
367779,B003B3OOPA,A2VCVT6YSISO6W,Coconut Oil,"I can't say enough about this wonderful product, and the amazing properties that it has... I use it in my oatmeal every morning, spread it on toast, cook with it, and use it on my skin. I began using it in Jan. of this year, after viewing the ""Alzheimers"" videos on F/B.<br />I put one tablespoon in my oatmeal everyday, as well as using it as a spread, etc.<br />My energy level is definitely elevated,and my skin is like silk..<br />Lots of potitives with this product.",5
367780,B003B3OOPA,A35L8LA80FC4S5,Solid in the jar but starts melting in your hands!!!,This is really a fantastic product. Ordered it for my hair. I have fine brunette chemically treated hair. Doing wonders for my hair and my skin.<br /> I love how it looks so solid in the jar but starts melting in your hands. It also does not run down your neck like the olive oil does!<br />It is a massive jar which can last years and I love the smell!,5
367781,B003B3OOPA,A1KGLT30RAOX9P,Great natural coconut oil,"I am using this for both health benefits (consumption) and for cosmetic purposes (application.) The product arrived on time in perfect condition. It tastes wonderful, feels great on my skin and has a very pleasant aroma. Everything that I ordered arrived very quickly and was packaged altogether because I used the free Super Saving shipping option. Fantastic! Overall, I am pleased with this product as it is the healthiest coconut oil that I could find without paying exorbitant prices. Thanks!",5

367783,B003B3OOPA,A39MWPBV4CX5,Love it!,"I love this coconut oil! I use it on my body, face, and hair. It also smells and tastes delicious. I can eat it plain, but one of my favorite ways to eat it is with some mini chocolate chips sprinkled over a spoonful of it. Yum! I also like to cook french toast in it and top my sweet potatoes with it. My only complaint is that it's a little grainy. I don't notice it so much when I eat it, but I do when I'm using it as a moisturizer. It's not that big of a deal though. And to be fair, this is the only coconut oil I have ever bought so I can't compare it to any other brands. I love it so much, though, that I have no reason to try any other brands.",5
367785,B003B3OOPA,AN7W9CYLLHS2X,Amazing product!,"This is an excellent product. I use it as a body moisturizer, my daughter uses it on her hair and I have also used it for cooking! It has a very delicate fragrance (even my boys thought it smelled nice). The taste is very mild and slightly sweet -- great for cooking. It is very hard but quickly softens in your hand. Amazing product! I am ordering more as a gift for family members who don't like all the chemicals in lotions!",5
367786,B003B3OOPA,A1RJS6052BP55N,Great product!,This organic coconut oil was exactly what I hoped it would be.  I use it for my very dry skin and it really does the trick!,5
367787,B003B3OOPA,A1IWH3V0K3WAQQ,Delicious!,"Very fresh oil with a creamy coconut flavor that melts on your tongue.  Solid at room temperature, but liquifies quickly.  I use it as a lotion and for my hair, nutritional supplement, occasional eye makeup remover, and sometime drinking chocolate mix-in.  Also used it in my morning smoothie, with frozen pineapples and milk, to make a pina colada-style drink.",5
367788,B003B3OOPA,A3I1VYCRNPD11T,Great Coconut Oil,"I love this coconut oil it is everything I was hoping for and then some! I use it for my hair and face and wow. I have frizzy, dry, curly hair and since I've been using the coconut oil my hair is smooth, straight and dandruff free!! I've had a horrible experience with an acne treatment and burned my eye sockets and the coconut oil has restored them back to normal and even made a few improvement because I see less wrinkles. I wanted to use this for my high cholesterol but have yet to start taking it as a supplement. From tomorrow on I will. =) Great buy, try it!",5

367790,B003B3OOPA,A4UMJSMYWQYIP,"Ease into if you're not used to it, pure quality product","You can taste the coconut. It's slightly sweet. I took about a generous tablespoon in my first ingestion attempt. Mind you, I've previously used other coconut oils before, but I would have to say the were greatly inferior to this product.<br /> I felt ill to the stomach within 30-45 minutes of consuming the tablespoon...I did what every American does, I googled. Turns out that it's common for those who have an overabundance of yeast in the system.  I drink tons of beer, well Belgian wheat ale to be exact, and the coconut oil reportedly acts as a detox according to some holistic opinions. I'm willing to give it a  further try. I think it's best that you ease into coconut oil therapy vice gobbling a juicy tablespoon of it. I will update this review in a few months, but few on people  on Amazon report experiencing any malaise from consuming coconut oil and I had to do a quick search to learn how common it is.<br />Otherwise, I concur that this is a superior product and if any true benefit would be redeemed from ingesting coconut oil, this would be one of the key ones to try.",5

Coconut is a natural antibacterial agent, so it's perfect for a facial wipe.

It has stopped my scalp from becoming dry and flaky like it used to do, yet it's light enough to not make my hair greasy (I have relaxed hair with the usual ""new growth""). This makes my skin feel soft and absorbs pretty easily, especially after the shower. I also love the light coconut scent.",5

""Don't worry about it,"" my parents would assure me, ""that goes away when you get older."" No, mom, I don't think so. I'm in my 20s and still have rough skin on the back of my arms and it's not fun. I've tried $50 creams, exfoliating scrubs, etc. from high end brands, and nothing has ever really worked. I've only used this a couple of times and I already feel a huge difference. I just use it right after the shower and it absorbs into my skin wonderfully. I liked it so much after using it the first time, that I used it on my legs, hands, etc. and my skin everywhere is softer than it has ever been. I even tried it on razor burn(I get the WORST razor burn), and it really helped soothe it overnight. I usually buy products for specific uses and this is my first time trying something completely natural on my skin, but I'm so glad I did.

I decided to make eggs for my dogs, myself, and my son and they were WEIRD BUT DELICIOUS. I will try sneaking this into my fiancee's food to see if he can taste a difference. What's weird is I felt full instantly and usually I eat alot so I can see where this is a good staple to my diet in losing excess weight =)",5

367809,B003B3OOPA,A1ODZXPH0UVLK5,Works well,"Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The extreme heat made the oil into a liquid form upon arrival. After letting it sit, it turned back into it's normal consistently. I used for my hair as I transition from a relaxer to a normal state. Haven't used to cook at all. It's a great addiion to my collection of hair products. Natural hairdresser said to use when hair is in natural state ONLY. Do not use when applying heat since the product is a 'heavy'.",5

367811,B003B3OOPA,AFYOLE1G27QP6,Smells and Tastes Amazing,The first thing I noticed about this brand of Coconut Oil was the smell. It is so sweet it made me want to start eating it right away. I use Coconut oil for baking and also as a moisturizer. I have not been disappointed at all with this brand.,5
367812,B003B3OOPA,AABNRC962KRS8,Great product with many uses.,"I bought this because I have eczema and I read coconut oil could help keep skin moist and prevent flare-ups.  I also knew it was a delicious choice for cooking and baking.  With both those applications and the effect I get when I use it on my hair as a pre-shampoo moisturizing treatment, it's really great.  I bought this brand at the store, really liked it, read reviews of it and others, and decided the lovely smell, the smooth texture and the subtle taste were ideal.  It's a great product and I recommend it to people all the time.",5
367813,B003B3OOPA,A3HGHBS4E57S83,excellent flavor,I enjoy mixing agave nectar with this coconut oil and using it as a dip for fruit & nuts! What a yummy nutritious treat!,5
367814,B003B3OOPA,A3GIAQV3EZ0HUS,"Very fresh, great quality",Ordered these to try them out and I must say this product is top notch. The oil smells and tastes like coconuts and it just appears of high quality. It gives some dishes a slight hint of coconut when used in cooking. I love this stuff. Will definitely keep ordering.,5
367815,B003B3OOPA,A2G69JC6JIHVPW,Smells Really Good,"I've been using this product for a year now and I want to say that it smells really good.  I use it to seal moisture in my hair.  I read on the package that you can also cook with it.  I haven't tried that yet, but it smells good enough to cook with.  I worried about the oil becoming solid in cooler temperatures, but surprisingly it stays liquified no matter what temperature.  It's not greasy at all... very light and coats the hair shaft well.  I highly recommend!",5

And coconut oil had been recommended to me by 2 separate friends that are amazing cooks and very very healthy people.  We made stir fry with it and won't go back to regular cooking oil, incredibly flavorful and I would say ""gourmet"".  There are instructions that this oil is meant for temperatures 350 and under. Baked a white birthday cake at 350 degrees with this oil and the cake had a great coconut flavor but came out drier.  But kids still devoured it.  Came super fast via mail, and a friend was right in recommending me buying this on Amazon vs. the store.",5
367823,B003B3OOPA,A1J7RSVCF7F7B3,So many uses for this!,"I use it for everything really...from cooking, to skin moisturizing, to hair balm. Works great! Even my pets love it.",5

Outstanding for cooking and imparts a subtle coconut flavor.  The only con is that it can generally be bought for around $5.00 - $6.00 on special at the supermarket. Regular price is about the same.,5
367827,B003B3OOPA,A2HCKBBEXELJ3R,Wonderful Product with Endless Applications,"I love raw organic unprocessed coconut oil and this brand I use quite often - both for sauteeing or just 'taking a swig' in the morning with a piece of toast (a version of dipping the bread into olive oil).  I live in pretty warm climate, so most of the time it maintains runny consistency.  In the winter it gets solid, but still very easy to work with.<br />I use it to make my own homemade chocolate (without white sugar) and with great results.<br /><br />I also make my own skin moisturizer with shea butter, argan oil, avocado and coconut oil and couple of drops of lavender oil.  It feels and works spectacular both on the skin or tiny amount on the hair.<br /><br />It's just all around marvelous product and if you have not yet, definitely try it!!",5

I love the smell of the product while cooking and it does give the foods you cook with it a nice taste; I especially like cooking my chicken with it.  I have been using it on my hair and have noticed that my hair has a sheen and weight to it which I used to have in my younger days.  So far, so good...",5

I tried parachute coconut oil that is pretty famous in India but then I realized that it did not suck that well into my skin so I decided to check Amazon for coconut oil and came across this product that has 5 stars. I decided to give it a try and within two uses I became a huge fan. This oil does not take time to penetrate skin and I felt so good after my shower. I am totally in love with this product and plan to use it for many more years. Love, love, love it. Yet to use it in food but will surely give it a try since it smells so fresh and good!",5
367832,B003B3OOPA,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,"Very good product, but a 60% price increase in a week?","I bought a jar of this thing on Aug 16 for seven bucks (and free delivery if over Amazon's minimum for such). It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).<br /><br />All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.<br /><br />One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"".<br /><br />OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).<br /><br />PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.<br /><br />PPS. Thanks to commenters Lulu and Adriana for additional info and helpful suggestions.",5

367847,B003B3OOPA,A307YFSORUAXSQ,A health Miracle in a Jar,"I love this stuff. It is delicious. It is solid at room temperature but I prefer it in liquid form which I achieve by running the jar under hot water. I take 1 tbsp about 3-4 times a day and use this as a moisturizer after the shower. It tastes yummy but I did have to get used to the feeling that I was swallowing oil. My hubby had no problem w this and even joked it was so good that he could drink it with a straw. I have suffered w a systemic yeast infection for years which has caused numerous skin problems and a nasty white tongue. This has cleared that up in a week. The pimples I had on my arms and thighs are gone and so are my undereye dark circles. My nails are growing smoothly and my hair stopped falling out when I brush. I also started using it as a vaginal moisturizer and I am extremely pleased with the results. I also noticed how it helped with my cold. My symptoms were mild whereas everyone else had a more severe reaction. It also helped with my cracking feet and my pinky toe, which has been blackened forever, is returning to normal. I love using it on the kids lips because I know when they lick it off it's not harmful. My hubby started taking it as well when he saw how I benefited and he loves the natural burst of energy he gets after. My daughter finally tried some and now loves it on her madelines in the morning. I cant say enough wonderful things about this product. I feel like a brand new person. I wish doctors knew more to recommend this instead of blaming loss of energy and skin problems on aging. This is healthy for you, gives you energy, aids in weight loss and kills bacterias, yeasts and fungus. First magazine just wrote an article on the benefits of adding coconut oil to your diet in their January issue. It's so good that I'm going to subscribe to it.<br />UPDATE: I still LOVE this product and use it daily. I've found it makes the best pancakes when you grease the griddle w some. It is an excellent wood cleaner and the only way I clean wood, now. I also make a lip scrub w a drop of coconut oil in the palm of my kids' hands and a pinch of sugar. They love how yummy it is, I don't worry if they get it in their mouths, and they no longer have dry, cracking winter lips. My youngest has been using it nightly, after her bath, and the excema that plagues her legs, hasn't returned w the dry, cold air. This has become one of the most used products in my home.",5
367848,B003B3OOPA,A3VHLWJTK3IL3T,Wonderful Product,"Recently, I wanted to ""up the ante"" on my Omega fatty acids so I added Coconut oil to go along with my doses of flaxseed oil and fish oil. Yes, Coconut Oil is a saturated fat, but because it's a medium chain tryclyceride (MCT), it's more easily absorbed by the body and converted into energy, not stored on the body as fat. This product has a nice flavor--I use it in cooking and it doesn't depart any heavy ""coconut"" flavor. Sometimes I just eat a tablespoon. The benefits are tremendous: microbial properties, helps thyroid, liver, pancreas, bones, skin, soothes the digestive tract. The list goes on.<br /><br />I bought one jar for the kitchen and one jar for my bathroom. This product is great to put on right after a bath or shower. Yes it's a bit greasy at first, but rub it in well and let it absorb, then wipe off the excess with a damp towel or wash cloth. Your skin will be satiny smooth.<br /><br />Bonus tip: I give a teaspoon to my dog every day. Studies show dogs' prefrontal brains benefit from this wonder fat.",5

I also love using it on my skin and hair - it makes them feel so healthy.<br /><br />I found that if you keep it at temps above 76 degrees it stays pretty clear - but if you live in a cooler climate (or have air conditioning) it can solidify.  I find that I can only consume it when it's in a liquid state - I seem to gag if it's even slightly solid.  Just a few seconds in the microwave can fix that.  I highly recommend this brand - it tastes great and works!,5

367955,B003B3OOPA,A2V2S4RAVP2Q10,Great for dry skin/eczema!,"I don't generally review products, but this works so well for me that I wanted to write about it in hopes someone with the same problem will read this and give coconut oil a try.<br /><br />For years I've been trying to find some sort of moisturizing lotion, ointment, or oil that would relieve my extremely dry skin. Lotions required constant reapplication, so they were expensive and inconvenient. Ointments were too thick and would make my skin hot and sometimes exacerbate itching. Baby oil didn't seem thick enough. The best solution I found was dissolving a bit of ointment in sesame oil with a dab of steroid ointment to control itching. It was okay, but not great. Plus, I quickly tired of smelling like popcorn.<br /><br />My dermatologist recommended that I try coconut oil. I've been astonished by how well it works. After only two days of use, my eczema rashes had faded considerably because they longer itched. Patches that I had for months were suddenly gone. The rest of my skin no longer feels dry and tight, which means no new rashes! I only have to apply coconut oil in the morning and after my shower with no need to reapply throughout the day. Best of all, I smell (quite literally) like a fresh coconut right after I apply it, and the scent fades rather quickly (so I don't get sick of it).<br /><br />I realize this sounds too good to be true, and I'll be sure to update if the product suddenly stops working. But for the time being, I'm absolutely thrilled with the improvement I've seen in my skin!",5

It has made me feel so much better, more energy, swelling in my throat has gone down and it tastes great! i make chocolate shakes with it. I also use it as a skin lotion, no more dry skin and it smells soo good. I use it on my hair, no more dry hair, it has helped me grow my hair out and its really shiny. I have also been using it on my face, it has completely gotten rid of my acne and is quickly fading my acne scars, and no it does not clog my pores. This coconut oil is amazing, i love it!!!",5
367957,B003B3OOPA,A2EOU64TXNBFEQ,Can't Ever Be Without,"I don't want to ever be without this coconut oil. I have been using it for quite some time now, and am 69 yrs of age.  I went to see my doctor for my six mths check up,  and she was amazed at my colostrol levels.  She said they were perfect, and wondered what my secret was.  I didn't tell her my secret,  but I do stay away from fatty foods,  and use this cooking oil for frying,  and also baking,  and it gives my food a wonderful flavor.  Tasting this oil alone,  has a delicious coconut taste,  but that same taste doesn't show up in the foods that I use it in, and I don't think one can beat this price anywhere.  I was paying twice as much as this from another company,  plus shipping and handling, but this is a super deal,  no postage,  and half the price.  I just hope Natures Way will never stop having this coconut oil available, I also like the fact that it is organic.  I will continue ordering this oil as long as it is available.",5

I use it in place of butter or margarine on my food, I use it to stir fry, I also use it on my face. I am a vegetarian and would recommend it to others. One of my favorite dishes is baked sweet potato, I cut a large one in half after baking and put Natures Way coconut oil, cinnamon, and pecan pieces on top. Everyone that eats one of these says ""I taste fresh coconut on this, how did you do that?"". I don't mean to rant but this product is something to rant about! Just try it, you will like it.",5
367960,B003B3OOPA,A2D1LVEV6WWZMC,Different from Nutiva,"I have always used Nutiva brand coconut oil and ordered this brand to try because it was on sale. From now on I will probably keep both brands in the house as I found them to be pretty different from one another and useful for different purposes. The Nutiva brand definitely has a lot more coconut flavor, adding a lot more flavor to smoothies or in cooking. This brand absorbs into the skin a lot faster, without leaving the oily film on top of the skin, so I will continue to use this coconut oil for skin and hair care.",5

367981,B003B3OOPA,A2CCYTJQNBHFA0,Lovely product.,"I use this product as a moisturizer.  It has a fabulous smell, and it is great quality coconut oil.  I had to order this since it's getting cold, because the oil becomes a solid.  Since this is in a jar, you can still scoop it out.  It is also a great moisturizer for curly hair.",5
367983,B003B3OOPA,A35BK88JWUFX5Q,Great for cooking,"I ordered this coconut oil a few weeks ago, since then I've used it in cooking to replace less healthy oils and in baking as a substitute for butter or margarine.  It easy to work with and it tastes fantastic.  I've used it in everything from stir fry to brownies, it's delicious and healthy.  Who could ask for more?",5

367989,B003B3OOPA,A3GYYKV5VNXZ33,Great all natural moisturizer,"I have been using this as a moisturizer (less than a teaspoonful) for my entire body and it hasn't caused any breakouts, even on my face. For this price, it is very economical and a purer moisturizer compared to many lotions. It melts in your hand and a little bit goes a long way.  It has a very slight coconut scent which reminds me of the beach and suntan lotion. It doesn't have a greasy feel and it doesn't transfer to clothes as long as you use just a little bit - you won't need much.",5
367990,B003B3OOPA,A1MJ3KKJ1KC50M,Smooth and Tasty,"I have been using this coconut oil for the past few days and I am happy with the results.  I first tried it on its own and the consistency was not too appealing to me, so I began putting it in my meals and that works better for me.  I have also used a portion of it with some Shea Butter as a moisturizer and it works great as well.  It seems to me the uses are endless.  I can see that I will be purchasing another container of this because it is so versatile and all natural.  I really love that and I love this coconut oil.  It does have a slight coconut taste and smell.  I get a hint of it when i cook with it but it is does not over power any of the dishes that I make with it.  Also it absorbs very quickly into the skin leaving it soft but not greasy and there is slight coconut smell but it fades quickly once absorb into the skin.  It is a bit pricey and is definitely an investment.  The serving size of 1 tablespoon 3-4 times a day is a bit much and will contribute to the necessity of purchasing another jar quicker than I would like.  Overall, very happy with my purchase.  As always thanks Amazon for such a wide and wonderful selection of products.",5
367991,B003B3OOPA,AF69ZA6KU0TH3,Coconut Oil,"I use this oil all the time for cooking. It adds a great flavor, especially to fish and chicken. Great for sauteing!",5

Her teachers and classmates always giving her compliments and inquiring about this product. I also mix it with shea butter works wonders on the skin especially during the winter season.

I wash it with castille soap first then use the coconut oil.<br /><br />Be aware that this does smell like coconut while I have tried others that do not. I love the smell, but it may turn some off.",5
368000,B003B3OOPA,A3E2FMQ629WEHY,"must try item, highly recommend to my family and friends","I have been using this stuff for 2 months and I absolutely love it for cooking.  I also use it for my body, face and hair.  Not sure about all the healthy hype but it is a must try product.  You do have to get use to the consistency depending on the weather it could be in a liquid form or hard.  It is a great moisturizer I have very dry skin, after 2-3 minutes you no longer feel oily and the slight smell of coconut also disappears.  I do moisturize before I go to bed not sure if I would do it in the morning before I get dress for work, I would be worried it might ruin my clothes.  So far I don't see any oily stain on my clothes of bed sheets. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3OOPA"">Nature's Way Organic Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce</a>",5

I will always come back here and purchase this. I've been missing out!<br /><br />Love it!!!<br /><br />Oh and I love the way it's packaged. That's very smart to put it in plastic<br />just in case there are any accidents.,5

It arrived in liquid form and I'm not sure if that is how it's supposed to be but I just put it in the freezer for a few minutes to harden it a bit. Smells amazing, just like real coconut. Great conditioner & it tastes good as well. I think I'll try cooking with this next! Very pleased",5
368005,B003B3OOPA,A1D0U7MPGWZRI,GREAT!!!,"Keeps my hair soft and moisturized. I use it as a sealant after I condition and I reapply throughout the week. I haven't noticed any build up, it just melts into my hair.",5

368007,B003B3OOPA,AXQ99FCFAHZM9,surprisingly yummy!!,"I ordered this as I've read about the health benefits for my particular health problems. I figured I would have to force it down, as I don't like coconut flavor. This has a very very mild flavor. It almosts tastes like a creamy butter spread. I'm loving it. It's great for skin as well, although I recommend if you're getting this for eating and skin/hair care either buy 2 different tubs, or take out some and put it in a seperate container for your skin care. You don't want to have germs in it. I think it's a great price for a great product.",5
368008,B003B3OOPA,A31EF4YRP05VSD,Delicious and good for you,Heard about the benefits of coconut oil on the Dr. Oz show. I tried several other brands and Nature's Way Organic just tastes better.<br />Especially delicious in stir frys. I buy it in bulk through Amazon which saves money. Good product and great service!,5
368010,B003B3OOPA,A2XQ80ADBQTV3H,The many uses of coconut oil...,"I purchased this item about a month ago. I wanted to wait until I had an opportunity to really use the product in many ways and to gauge the results.  I started out taking tablespoon as soon as I purchased it...and soon discovered that other reviewers are correct - some people have to work their way up to taking a tablespoon. Now I take a table spoon in the morning mixed with a protein shake. Sometimes, I mix it in hot coffee or tea. I have also started taking an additional tablespoon in the afternoon either spread on crackers or a small piece of bread.  As a food, it gives me an extra boost of energy and seems to make me more alert.  I have begun to lose weight but I am not certain if this is because of the coconut oil or because I have implemented a walking routine. Either way, it gave me the energy to want to get up and get moving! I also use it as a moisturizer on my skin. It does go on rather oily, but it absorbs quickly. I just have to make certain that I give myself enough time for the oil to absorb before putting on certain fabrics. I was in awe regarding how soft my skin felt. Rough patches are now smooth.  I have stopped using a popular African American hair moisturizer on my son's hair and began using this.  All I can say is his hair loves coconut oil. It improved his texture.  I have also used it on an area of his head that seemed prone to razor bumps.  It is healing well. Finally, I read that this is safe for dogs.  I gave some to my dog and now he demands it each morning. He loves it too.",5
368011,B003B3OOPA,A3E812AMDDPZ5T,awesom!!,"This stuff is awesom!! I use it on my hair and as a body moisterizer ,leaves my skin soft and my hair shiny .  i will be ordering some more very soon :)",5
368012,B003B3OOPA,A2LVXOA4WUIL84,Smells fresh and moisturizes well,"This oil smells like fresh coconut, which is what a good-quality coconut oil should smell like. It had a few pieces of real coconut floating at the bottom, which actually made it feel much more ""authentic"" to me. Interestingly enough, it arrived in liquid form (it's hot here) and I slathered it on my elbows right away. It worked great! Softened and smoothed them and got rid of that leathery feel. Can't wait to use it as a full-body moisturizer after a shower (just not on the face--never put coconut oil on the face if you don't like clogged pores).",5
368013,B003B3OOPA,A2I4KD3RHPWNS0,Love Coconut Oil,"I have bought several brands of coconut oil, but this one is Pure, has an excellent taste.  Coconut Oil has a million uses.  Don't hesitate to buy this product.",5
368014,B003B3OOPA,AN4OIHPDX1KSS,great for diaper rash and whatever ails you!,"I bought this product because I read that organic coconut oil helps heal and sooth diaper rash.  Not only did it work amazingly, but I love how it smells. I've used it on my baby for massages and an all-over moisterizer.  It also worked when my baby had a little bit of dry scalp.  I have used it in for me in my hair as a de-frizz serum, on knees and elbows for healing really dry skin, and also as chapstick.  Great product at a great value!",5
368015,B003B3OOPA,A3JGPALN1C8Z1O,Wonderful stuff!,"I use this coconut oil on my face and body as a moisturizer and I love it!  The smell is wonderful (yes, it smells like coconut).  It arrived as a solid but if I put it in the sun or set it in some warm water it becomes a liquid oil. I find I can put it on my skin in either liquid or ""solid"" states because even solid it is still very soft.",5

368018,B003B3OOPA,AW0SOAPEY2I7,Yummy,I just got the oil and tasted it and it is great.  We will mix it with some coconut oil that doesn't have a flavor so that it all has the flavor.  Then we will continue to buy this kind.,5

368020,B003B3OOPA,A2U5SDCRUIIRQP,Great in smoothies!,"I didn't realize that coconut oil could be used as a moisturizer? I put a tablespoon in my smoothies and I can't even taste it.

I like this brand, and it's organic.",5
368021,B003B3OOPA,A1WHOKAF6B4YJC,Amazing,"I could just eat this out of the jar. It's so full of flavor, aroma and not greasy, just light. Flavor in cooking is very light. Bought another pricier brand at the same time to compare -- This one beat it hands down. SO good.",5

I use it for cooking, drop a plop into a smoothie, use it on my skin and hair...all great so I won't revisit all of that.  This product specifically is a very high quality and the price on Amazon is phenomenal. It arrived promptly and in good condition.  Nature's Way sells some great products.  This is no exception.",5
368026,B003B3OOPA,A5QNJVQGPQ18N,Nutiva fan now in love with Nature's Way!,"When buying coconut oil, I often research every option possible and compare the price per ounce.  I make and sell granola and need to get the best price possible without sacrificing quality.  I decided to try a jar of this, because it was the lowest price, yet still organic and extra virgin.  I am so glad I did!  I actually prefer it, because it stays liquid until you open it.  In order to use coconut oil in my granola, I have to melt it first.  This brand, I did not have to melt first, only if I used some from an already-opened jar.  So it is just fine with me, actually better, that it comes in small jars. I ordered quite a lot more after trying it, afraid the price would go up after all the EVCO fans caught on to the deal.  Thanks, Nature's Way, I love it!!!",5

I've not used it for cooking yet, but I am intrigued at the thought.",5
368029,B003B3OOPA,AOQDWIBN3R03,Miracle Stuff!,"It cured my dry, itchy, bumpy skin (arms & legs) by second day - just use it like lotion after shower while skin is still moist/damp (I used loofah scrub first).  My skin feels like baby skin and itching is gone.  It really smells nice after soaking into your skin, which happens pretty quickly, and greasiness is gone - I can't stop smelling my arms.<br /><br />Also use this in cooking a lot.  It was great with banana bread - just substitute 1/4 to 1/2 of melted butter called for in the recipe (don't substitute all the butter, I believe the bread will be drier if you just use coconut oil).  As a kid, we used pure coconut oil as hair conditioner in my hometown.  So tonight, I will use it on my heels because they are always dry since I wear sandals a lot.  I bought this in Amazon a while back and it was very cheap compared to WholeFoods price.",5

So far, I've put it on my neck, my hair, added to my rice, some milk, and some ice cream. Oh, and I've also gargled with it! I am excited to find many uses for this yummy stuff!

As it feels very smooth on your face.<br />Just try out how much to use, not more then half of a small nail size for sure, otherwise it will be to oily.<br />I was reluctant to try tasting it, but it really tasts very good, unless you hate coconut.<br />Will definitely try it for cooking as I have two different containers.<br /><br />When I had a small acne breakout, and one of those undercover pimples that threaten to come out and stay around for days it was gone in 3-4 days and never surfaced. So so far very good. Will keep using it and update accordingly.<br /><br />Only thing I want to caution everyone, after showering I decided to use it as all over body oil, I recall rubbing it in , but obviously not good enough , as I did go to bed an hour or so later, and the next morning I noticed dark grey stained spots on the bedsheet, I tried to wash them and use stain remover but no luck, I also saw there were some stains on the bathrope.

It lives up to all the hype, and I assume it's as good for me as everyone says. It's solid at room temperature, easy to scoop and spread, and has a great, mild flavor. I've tasted it plain, added it to smoothies, spread it on bread, and used it in place of butter for cookies. Very versatile.",5
368049,B003B3OOPA,A535EB54QXFJV,Better than I thought it would be,"I was skeptical of the difference in all natural organic and the stuff you get from a regular grocery store.  I bought other coconut oil mostly due to the fact that it was the same price as olive oil and I thought it was ""all natural"" as it basically stated it on the container.  After reading reviews of the other stuff I bought not being organic I decided to give this a try.  While this is definitely pricier, the difference is astounding!  If you like the taste of coconuts, this is the bomb.  The other tasted nothing like coconuts, or really anything at all, so when I opened the container of this I was quite intrigued.  I put this on vegetables and when I cook fish and it definitely helps with the vegetables since I have to generally force myself to eat them.  With that said, I don't think I would buy this product again simply due to price.  I would go to another brand assuming they are as good since you can buy much more for only a little bit more in cost.  This changed my whole view toward organic, and hopefully makes me healthier.  If you read this review look at all the stuff they put in processed food ... specifically benzene!  I work in chemical plants, so I know how terrible this stuff is, and the fact they use it in food processing blows my mind!  Also, the fact that they don't have to tell you is even crazier.  There is no way this type of stuff doesn't harm you!",5

368053,B003B3OOPA,A3F1G6UH4Y39X2,"Alive, Ageless, Gourmet and Gathering Years... meaning the oil!]","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 9:15 Mins<br /><br /></span>Some say the COCONUT palm is the Tree of Life.  They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.<br /><br />In my opinion, EVAGold, and the Nutiva brand of coconut oil shown in the video, are among the highest qualities available, of life healing offerings from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of a jar of EVAGold on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust Swanson [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG"">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz Spray</a>.<br /><br />Reading Bruce Fife's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS"">The COCONUT OIL MIRACLE</a>, provided necessary information for working  with this fruit.  Reading that book also clarified my previous belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil, and in these brands' production purity [other excellent brands are also available; these two are just the ones I've used successfully so far].  My experience of using this type of cold pressed, virgin coconut oil for only 24 hours had shown results which made me feel blessed!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4"">The MAGNESIUM MIRACLE</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, could work as a catalyst for magnesium, while magnesium works as a catalyst for all other nutrients, including coconut oil, to function correctly.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my Amazon.com reviews on magnesium products and the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great Magnesium and Coconut books and products are available, easily found using search capacities.<br /><br />According to some experts, the most important thing to know about oils, fats, and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to some experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods, additives, and supplements can defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than magnesium, and in the current food marketplace and general eating habits; calcium is usually assimilated in large quantities, causing illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This situation is detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons like me who are severely deficient in magnesium is that most offerings of coconut I'm aware of hold more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.<br /><br />In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.<br /><br />Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient...<br /><br />With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some experts say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary nutrients, in order to live strong and disease free. [See my review of Dr. Dean's book.]<br /><br />Maybe magnesium seats life, coconut is the cozy catalyst, and taste buds rule!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Other excellent coconut oils available on Amazon:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />[The link above goes to the large size, the one I showed in my review on Bruce Fife's book]<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64"">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a> [This is the product used in the video here.

Oil is not a whole food and is pure saturated fat. You may want to debate me on this, but I am not open to change my view (I have studied up on this and know I feel much better and have more energy without loading up on lots of fat and protein).<br /><br />I prefer to use this oil for my hair and as a moisturizer for my body.  It has a great smell (I think about the coconut butter people use when they go to the beach) and it is certified organic.

I have been searching for a solution for dry skin and hair that did not involve a concoction slop of chemical madness. Massage this into your skin after a hot shower or before bed for great results. It also works great as a hair moisturizer and I even use it for hot oil treatment. Coconut oil absorbs very well into my hair without leaving it greasy (a little goes a long way). Make sure to put it on last as a sealant for any other moisturizers that you use. I feel a lot better knowing that something I am putting onto my skin and absorbing into my bloodstream does not contain a mass of impossible to pronounce ingredients. My only advice is that you find some kind of bottle to put it in or mix it into your favorite lotion. I rinsed out an empty shampoo bottle. I find that at room temperature, constantly dipping your hand in gets kind of messy. I love it!",5

368060,B003B3OOPA,A3DTNINKMCO9OH,I first got this for baby's eczema...,"I was looking for natural moisturizers that alleviate symptoms of eczema and I came across this coconut oil.  My baby is 5 months old and after 24 hours of applying this oil from head to toe, his red patches were significantly reduced.  My whole family was amazed at the results.  No, it is not a cure but it is a good moisturizer to use on a baby with eczema, espeically for the face since my baby sucks on his hands, rubs it all over his cheeks and then takes it right back into his mouth.<br />I decided to take 3 tsps a day (now a bit more because I love the taste and texture so much) as a supplements since it has antifungal and lots of lauric acid (found in breastmilk) which strengthens the immune system.  I was hoping that some of it will get passed on to my milk and help my son fight his eczema from the inside.  Actually, I read that eating just 3 tsps a day, the lauric acid content in breastmilk jumps up from 3% to 9%.  As far as the results, I don't know if the coconut oil through my breastmimlk helped him but I sure got hooked!  I love the taste, texture, and look forward to taking my suuplemental tlbs.  I plan to bake with it this weekend and have asked my husband to use it for cooking as well.  I've rubbed some on my hands and face and it feels really soft and well moisturized.  I haven't tried it in my hair yet but plan too.  When I told my coworkers about my new obsession, they seemed a bit confused but really, read about the countless benefits and see how easy it is to substitue coconut oil for so many of your daily care and food.

368065,B003B3OOPA,A3IX5ZKGGYUGLF,AMAZING,"Trying to find a natural alternative for my acne I came across this and hooked Since my first day of college my face that was once flawless exploded into acne (I was 18 then). It hurt, throb, left scars, terrible blemishes, cystic acne along my cheek and chin area, very oily t-zone, large pores on my cheeks, blackheads and dry patchy areas. Worse thing about it I had new ones almost everyday and my chest and acne were the same.<br />Desperate I read up all the natural benefits in using coconut oil internally and externally and it i knew it wouldn't hurt to try. My face was terrible as it is. Anyway when I started applying this externally, my back and chest acne lessen within a month and a half. I have to say it didn't disappear like magic however I notice my skin felt smoother, my skin tone was more even than before,my dry patchy area disappeared and best of all less acne. But my cystic acne still kept coming.<br />So determined I changed my chemical based products into 100% natural. Basic natural cleanser, toner, and moisturizer which is my bestfriend coconut oil and also a healthy diet. Within 6 months of using this externally and internally my face is completely clear with only a once and while breakout and I'm currently 1 month away from being 20 and almost getting to flawless. Except my acne scars is a huge problem for me for the moment.<br />My sisters and I also use it for deep hair conditioning, and some facial treatments.<br />Coconut Oil is creamy and delicious as well. I love eating this with my toast and putting it in my favorite coconut chicken curry. I've noticed when eating coconut oil or just adding it into my food my appetite isn't as big as it was before. Not sure if its because its a healthy type of fat.But anyway I absolutely love, love , love this product.<br /><br />however with the acne part, its not for everyone. I'm fortunate enough that this work wonderfully for me. But it wouldn't hurt to try. Its affordable and no harsh chemicals added at all.",5

They have skin issues & applying the oil topically as well as feeding it to them healed their skin in a matter of days. Using it on my face instead of lotion is clearing my combination skin up. It's like a miracle oil. Highly recommend it.",5
368067,B003B3OOPA,A1SGUI3RORSZ33,"Delicious and Fresh, no complaints in regards to the product quality...BUT","I love this coconut oil, I ordered 4 quantities and all of them were super fresh and tasted very delicious. The texture was great and it's a joyous treat to use every time. Coconut oil has many uses, but I use it mainly as a dietary supplement. I use it to cook my morning eggs or sauteing vegetables with the omelet, add some to my oatmeal every morning, put a little in my tea or coffee, add some to my protein or fruit shakes, or just take it by the spoonful which is melt in your mouth deliciousness.<br />I am a very active person and a health nut, and I follow a low-carb diet and way of life, so I put great emphasis on consuming lots of quality oils and fats in my diet. Coconut oil makes the perfect addition. I am 100% satisfied with the quality of this coconut oil.<br /><br />However, having said all of this, one thing that I wish was different about the product was the package. The jar is plastic and my limited knowledge in chemistry points me to the old knowledge that ""like dissolves like""... and since oils and plastics are both derived from nonpolar substances, this leads me to worry that there will be plastic leaking into the oil. Albeit this is a tremendously slow process, nonetheless it still makes me second guess coming back to this product and purchasing a brand that uses glass jars instead. If they change their packaging methods, I will have no problem purchasing this brand again. Although, I did not take off any stars for this reason because most coconut oil packages these days seem to come in plastic containers, so it wouldn't be fair to rate this brand less than others.<br /><br />One thing that I have done to lessen my worry is to refrigerate the oil so that it solidifies. My rationale behind this is that less oil is in contact with the plastic container when the oil is solidified because only the edges touch as opposed to a liquid form, which is constantly mixing and makes more surface area contact. I actually like to take my coconut oil when solidified because I like how it melts slowly when eaten and you can savor the taste better.<br /><br />I hope this helped others.",5
368069,B003B3OOPA,A389KK46AH771B,One of my New Kitchen Staples,"There was a time when I went out of my way to avoid coconut oil - I'm not quite sure if I was confusing it with palm oil, or if medical science was actually lumping it together with all the other saturated fats as a dietary NO-NO.  Of course that's all changed now, and coconut oil is recognized as one of the 'good' oils - but it was still only recently that I had a chance to try it for myself.  Wow!  It's great stuff.<br /><br />Coconut oil has a unique quality in that it has a melting point of 76 degrees, F - and out here where I live (Oregon), that means I seldom see it as a liquid oil (even in summer) - but that's fine with me, for one of the things I like using it for is in biscuits and pie crust, and for those, it has to be solid - and as a solid fat, coconut oil is quite hard (really hard!), even when close to 75 degrees - and for that reason, it is much better for use in baking, where a hard fat works much better than a soft one.<br /><br />But another characteristic of coconut oil that I love is its flavor and aroma - when you open the jar and stick your nose down in it, you are enveloped in the beauty of the coconut's best element, its aroma - its almost frightening how beautiful that smell is.  Maybe it's just me, but that aroma literally sends me to the tropics each time I open the jar.<br /><br />And then there's the flavor.  Most fats have little or no flavor - in fact, as cooks we've been taught to use a fat with no flavor in our cooking.  However, we all know that many fats are flavor!  And if we remove the fat, we lose much of the flavor.  Well friends, coconut oil is a fat with super flavor!  Anything you make with it will have the subtle flavor of the topics - I use it when I make rice, when I do S E Asian dishes and curries, and to make great scrambled eggs.  When you begin using it, coconut oil will open new doors of creativity in your cooking - and you will love it too.",5

368072,B003B3OOPA,AGO8L0LT7IV9Y,"Tastes Good, Great Price, May Help Your Health","I came across some research that suggested organic extra virgin coconut oil might help people suffering from Alzheimer's.  Before giving it to my parents, I decided to test it myself to see how it tasted and to check for side effects.  A visit to the health food store and I was ready to check it out.<br /><br />Honestly, it has replaced butter and olive oil in most of my applications, becoming my fat of choice.  It may all be in my head, but I am convinced I am ""sharper"" when taking it.  My parents are getting about a tablespoon a day, and enjoy it on bread as a treat.  They are more alert than they were more than a year ago - I can't prove it's because of the coconut oil, but it's the only thing we've changed.  Draw your own conclusions....<br /><br />When I found Nature's Way at Amazon, the price blew me away.  When I read about the subscription program (save some $ and get free freight), I decided to try it.  Getting 16 ounces is convenient, and having it come regularly with free shipping (even though it's less than $25) makes it a great value...and it tastes better than the stuff I'd gotten at the health food store.<br /><br />Heck, it's under $10 - give it a try!",5
368073,B003B3OOPA,AZ0QC2GDDP6OK,Topical miracle...!!,"After doing a lot of research on coconut oil, I knew I had to give it a try. The product arrived quickly and as a liquid (I live in FL and it is summer- i expected this), and the smell is just sooooo delicious!!I have not used it in cooking yet, as I started using it topically and want to order a separate batch to cook with, but I have to say I am completely BLOWN away by the effects it has had on my skin already. I am a fair skinned female and have always been a target for mosquitoes. For most of my life I have been embarrassed by the multiple and never ending itchy, ugly bug bites and rashes these annoying little things have left on my skin. (mostly my ankles and legs) and am sometimes reluctant to wear shorts, dresses, and things that don't cover my legs (Which can be very difficult, considering just how HOT it is in FL)because it makes me feel self conscious and less confident about myself.<br /><br />Naturally, when I received the product the first place I started lathering it onto was my feet and legs, and I continued to do this several times a day. I WISH I had taken a before and after photo, as I did NOT expect the results to turn out as they did. Within 2 days, many of the little red spots had COMPLETELY disappeared. Furthermore, the scars and marks that were left from previous encounters have started to fade and are becoming less noticeable each day. Mind you, I have only been using the stuff for about 2 weeks. But like I said, I am completely blown away by the effects thus far. Additionally, I have started to apply the oil to a few moles that I have, and am very excited to see if there are any results in a few weeks (I will follow up with this post as needed)<br /><br />I order items frequently from amazon.com, and do not have the time to review many of the things I purchase. However, the effects from the coconut oil literally seemed to good to be true and now I know why many others have felt the need to 5 star review this product as well. I am a pharmacy student who is turning more and more to alternative treatments and natural remedies every day. I can not wait to be able to educate the public in regards to products such as this.

Too rich for me so, I decided to put it in a cup of coffee. It was delicious!! I used Columbian coffee (Green Mountain, Fair Trade Select K-Cup), sugar and some hemp milk (Pacific Natural Foods). That is definitely a keeper!! If you don't drink coffee, I'm sure it would work great in a cup of hot cocoa as well.<br /><br />Later, I decided to try it in some oatmeal. I mixed the following into a cup of cooked oatmeal: 1/2 Tsp cinnamon, 2-3 Tsp sugar, 1 Tbsp coconut oil. When the coconut oil melted completely, I added 3-4 Tbsp hemp milk to cool it down. My taste-buds were amazed!! Tomorrow, I will try this with raisins. Mmmmm.<br /><br />We make a lot of fruit shakes at our house and I've had coconut in them before, so I know this will taste great in a shake too. Here's the recipe I'm going with: Banana, Cantaloupe, Orange Juice, Ice, Hemp Milk, Honey (maybe) and Coconut Oil.<br /><br />I still have to find one more meal that I can add this to in order to keep up with the recommended 4 x 1 Tbsp daily dosage, but I'm sure it will be no problem to find something else that this goes well with.",5

Since I noticed a difference in my hair I wanted to make sure that my hair was softer because of the coconut oil, because I had just started using the Suave Professional conditioner; so when it was time to shampoo my hair again, I put the same conditioner on my hair sat under the hair dryer for thirty minutes with the setting on low as usual without the coconut oil on my hair and noticed that my hair was not as soft as when I used the coconut oil on my hair in addition to the conditioner.  My hair was still soft, not to imply that Suave Professional is not a good conditioner and didn't make my hair soft.  However, my hair seemed much softer when I used the coconut oil and the conditioner on my hair.  It is also great to use on the scalp as well.  Usually when I grease my scalp with sulfur 8 fresh hair & scalp conditioner (in the yellow jar with the blue cap) after washing and conditioning my hair within three to four days I wash and grease my hair again because my scalp no longer feels clean.  Since I started greasing my scalp with the coconut oil first, just a very little on the scalp area, then put the sulfur 8 fresh hair and conditioner on my scalp on the same scalp area where I put the coconut oil, my scalp feels healthier; after only two treatments of greasing my hair with the coconut oil and sulfur 8.  I am assuming that using the coconut oil with any conditioner and any hair grease will make the hair and scalp feel healthier, softer and easier to manage.  I highly recommend using this product or any other coconut oil if you want to use the product to help with the conditioning of your hair and/or scalp.",5
368095,B003B3OOPA,A2AS889M5PMZNZ,Muy bueno,"Honestamente este aceite de coco, no tiene que envidiarle nada al ""Barlean's Organic Oil"", ambos tienen el saber muy similar la unica diferencia que encontre fue el precio.",5

368108,B003B3OOPA,A1DIYN6WXS430U,Amazing,"This oil is AWESOME! It solidifies in the appropriate temperature and does amazing things to my hair. I slept with the oil from the middle to my ends for several nights and already felt as though my ends were stronger and healthier.<br /><br />I didn't use it for cooking, as most reviews I've read did, but I DID use it in:<br /><br />- my long Asian locks<br />- my hot sultry baths (yummy!)<br />- and my skin<br /><br />ALL of which were incredibly beneficial! PLEASE try! Such a good deal, lasts forever -- As I live in Santa Barbara and have access to some amazing beaches, I EVEN used it for outdoor tanning!",5
368110,B003B3OOPA,A2EIDL9KC24KBE,"Curbs Your Appetite, Gives You Energy & Makes You Regular!","I decided to order this product after reading a few books about the benefits of coconut oil.  I received this product about two weeks ago & here are my observations:<br /><br />1)  It totally curbs my appetite and gives me a sense of satisfaction so I don't have to eat every couple of hours.<br /><br />2)  It gives me so much energy!  I usually have to drink two cups of green tea to get me going & maybe a cup of coffee if it's a very busy day but since I started using coconut oil, my energy level is higher and I get a lot more done without burning out.<br /><br />3)  It made me regular, not to be too detailed but you will have a movement after almost every meal.<br /><br />4) No morning breath!<br /><br />5)  Soft, silky skin & hair.<br /><br />6)  No toothache.  I had a cap that came loose so I had my dentist bond it back on but it kept bothering me as if it was infected or something but since I started using coconut oil, whatever was going on is totally healed.<br /><br />We are on our 2nd bottle already!  I love it so much I also use it as moisturizer, just be careful when applying it to your shoulders, especially if you have long hair, it will make your hair greasy.<br /><br />I hope you have the same positive experience.",5
368111,B003B3OOPA,A372XGNN8NBS7J,Awesome product!,"My Mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two or three years ago and didn't even seem much like my Mother anymore.  I started giving her the coconut oil slowly--just a teaspoon a couple of times a day at first, but graduated that upward to at least three tablespoons per day--and my Mother gradually appeared again.  If you have a loved one with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia, you should do some research on that.  It is worth the bother!  The product smells and tastes really great!<br /><br />The service has also been great!  I have it scheduled to deliver a certain amount of the product at a certain time interval.  I don't have to bother to remember to reorder it.  It comes like clock-work!",5
368112,B003B3OOPA,A3T1LD0C65QCWK,Great for hair care and for cooking,"I'd suggest to buy TWO containers, one for hair use and one for cooking use. I originally bought this to use on my daughter's hair -- she fussed a bit about leaving it in her hair for two hours, but the results were amazing, far better than any conditioner we've tried on her hair.<br /><br />I don't care for the taste of this oil on toast but it's terrific for frying -- eggs, hash browns, greasing the griddle for pancakes -- superior results, better than butter, better color, better taste. It's pretty much a 1:1 replacement for butter. Very pleased with this product.",5
368113,B003B3OOPA,A39JG126NWVWKX,Wow where has coconut oil been all my life - just Google the health benefits and be amazed!,"This is my first experience with coconut oil. I heard about it and read up online and was amazed at the health benefits. I found this brand to have the best reviews/price so I went with it. I'm getting ready to purchase my 3rd one in as many months. It has a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor and is now one of only 3 oils I use in my cooking (+olive oil, avocado oil).<br /><br />My uses:<br />-Replace butter/fat/oil for non-stick cooking - except when using olive or avocado oil, this is my go to. In the skillet before eggs/bacon/pancakes/etc.<br />-On toast/pancakes etc. as a butter replacement - that little hint of coconut is delicious and the fattiness is reminiscent of butter.<br />-A tablespoon in my smoothies (for the health benefits)<br />-Oil replacement in baking recipes - it works just as well and is healthier!<br /><br />It's important to note that in cooking, the coconut flavor does not persist. If I add it raw I get that flavor but my eggs/bacon, for example, do not have coconut flavor after being cooked in this oil.<br /><br />HEALTHY: Read up on all the health benefits but here's the main one: yes this is a saturated fat. However, it's made up of medium-chain fatty acids. This type of fat is readily converted to energy and rarely stored as fat. Research shows that coconut oil (in moderation, of course) helps you lose weight and speeds up your metabolism. A few tablespoons a day is GOOD FOR YOU!<br /><br />My only con for this product is the plastic jar/tub. I hate plastic. Glass would be nice, as always!",5
368114,B003B3OOPA,A1TDLSUDVVJAWQ,Great for hair,"I bought this to use as a hair conditioner after reading about it in a magazine. I have long thick hair with split ends. When it came in I decided to try it. It has a wonderful nutty smell and is solid at temps below 70 degrees. I took a chunk out and rubbed it into my palms and then into my hair after shampooing. I made the mistake of just rinsing it out instead of following with another shampoo. Don't do this unless you want grease head! So, the next time I did the same thing, shampoo my hair first apply the coconut oil and allow it to sit for a while, but this time I shampooed it out. Boy what a difference! My hair was soft, shiny and manageable for the rest of the week. I now use it about once a week as a deep conditioner. Great stuff and I'm glad that I found it.",5
368115,B003B3OOPA,A3BFN91Z2MAUBK,"Bought it for my dog, but love it for myself!","I initially bought this for my dog.  She has sensitive, dry skin, and will get rashes on her legs.  I just rub this in and wah-lah!  No more itchy skin.  Not to mention, unlike so many other products, it is completely fine if she decides to go to lick-town on it.  It also smells amazing, so it isn't a big deal if she gets it on something.  I also have dry skin, so I will rub it on my elbows and massage it into my scalp.  After that, you can put it in recipes in place of butter in order to replace some bad fat with good fat.  I am all for a product that is multipurpose and very ecofriendly.  Anytime you can go natural, you definitely should.  Maybe it's just the glue-eating kid in me, but I think it's pretty awesome that I can eat my conditioner/lotion.",5

I ordered this yesterday and received it today.  Amazing.",5
368119,B003B3OOPA,A1XHN1HH440ZIU,...great for Hair!,"I recently bought this product after hearing great reviews on it and I can say that I definitely agree. I use this on my hair exclusively, I am an African-American and have natural hair. I usually just ""seal"" my hair with this, which it's good for, but it can be greasy. I don't really know how to combat that, but it doesn't really have too much of a smell either, which is good b/c I don't know how I feel about the smell of coconut. The amount is quite enough for the price, but depending on how much you use it may not last as long as it looks like it will. Mine probably won't last too long, but I will definitely buy again.",5
368120,B003B3OOPA,A3BVN2QBNPBHCR,Wow!  The best smelling and tasting coconut oil yet!,"I'm very strict with my diet. I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients. I've tested 4 other brands of organic coconut oil -- Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, and 2 small scale raw food companies. This one is easily the best so far.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful and the texture is much fuller than the other brands. This coconut oil has fuller taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is the one.<br /><br />Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is:<br /><br />1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much. Great for people missing gallbladders and truly everyone.<br /><br />2) Converts to usable energy very quickly. A much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc)<br /><br />3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Keeps your digestive system very clean inside. Helps destroy candida and balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria. Helps the immune system.<br /><br />4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected. Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body. Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the ""eat every 3 hours"" cravings that so many people this is hunger. Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body.<br /><br />5) Tastes great. Smells great.<br /><br />6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft. Is absorbed into the skin to nourish it, unlike most cosmetic moisturizers which leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance.<br /><br />7) Can be used as a sexual lubricant. Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem.<br /><br />8) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner. Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the body's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners. Plus, because coconut is anti-""everything bad"" it will keep the hair clean too!<br /><br />9) Coconut oil detox cleanse. The medium-chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-""everything bad"" properties. The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day). The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well. You can find the instructions by Googling ""Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse"".<br /><br />Basically, coconut oil is amazing! And this brand is the best I've found so far. Enjoy!<br /><br />*** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil.  Visit coconutdiet (dotcom)",5
368121,B003B3OOPA,A1Z0VDSYKCQTRH,Cannot live without this product!,"I am in sheer heaven! It smells sooo wonderful. Not overpowering, just a subtle scent. I'm using this product as a skin softener (marvelous), hair product (so soft) and for cooking (light, tasty). Although, I have 3 different bottles for their uses. I keep them refrigerated for longevity (just a preference). I prefer the product in its solid state rather than the liquified state for use.<br /><br />Add a few drops to your lotion, use in your co-wash bottles and great when grilling foil wrapped seafoods and brush on shish kebabs and grilled veggies. Its light.<br /><br />I will remain a faithful consumer of this product.<br /><br />Nina",5
368122,B003B3OOPA,A2E5WDE65T1XEX,Love love love this product!,"I'm new to the coconut oil hype, but so far I can say the excitement is totally founded.  I haven't tried it internally yet, but the external use has been amazing.  I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms (upper and lower), legs, and butt (yay, me!).  I've only ever found one cream by Lush that made any difference, and it was very expensive.  Enter, coconut oil! First, you will notice that it comes as a solid (unless the temperature is above 72 degrees, then it melts, which is ok, don't panic).  You take a bit and rub it between your hands and it melts instantly.  You're going to think first: oh yuck, I'm not putting this on my body! But please do: rub it anywhere and everywhere.  You'll notice how at firstit doesn't seem to be sinking in, but if you wait about ten minutes, it will do just that.<br /><br />I should also mention I have a sensitive skin on my face, which despite proper exfoliating, sheds skin often.  I get dry patches that, when at their worst, act like burns that open and are painful.  I know, pretty gross.  I'm usually cautious about trying new products on my face because it's so sensitive.  For years I've been using Eucerin, but it's not always enough.<br /><br />I through caution to the wind and slatered my face with the coconut oil.  It felt pretty gross at first, but within ten minutes it started to sink it.  I was nervous that I would wake up in the morning with oil-induced acne, but that didn't happen.  What did happens was that it had sunk in completely and my face was the smoothest and softest I'd ever seen.  Honestly, I couldn't stop touching my face!  Of course this meant my makeup went on better, and I looked...I don't know...I guess the word is well-rested.<br /><br />Another HUGE bonus is that while the dots on my arms still look like they're there, my keratosis pilaris is all but gone!  My arms, legs, (and yes, butt) are the softest and smoothest I've ever seen them.  I can't believe this worked! As you're working the oil into your skin, don't forget to rub it into your nails and eyelashes too.  I swear my eyelashes look longer andI know my nails are definitely stronger.<br /><br />Lastly, this product is CHEAP, you really can't go wrong with it.  I have two tubs of it, one for my body and the other for my diet (the thought of using one for both grossed me out). I'll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />Anyway, consider this a five-star, two thumbs way up review!",5
368123,B003B3OOPA,A3LS7BZ2Z53G2L,Miracle for Your Skin!,"I bought this product after my sister gave me a sample of the coconut oil she uses, and it left my skin looking much improved after 2 1/2 years of full-time work and full-time school (plus a husband and kids) left my face broken out from stress.  Coconut oil in general is amazing!  It has cleared up about 90% of my hormonal acne and after I wash my face and use the coconut oil, my face looks so healthy, glowing, and clean.  It seems to go against all sound advice to slather oil on your face, but it really works!  My husband even uses it each night after washing, and I've really noticed a change in his skin.  I have recently been using it on my entire body and have such soft skin (elbows and knees included).<br /><br />For this particular brand of coconut oil, it doesn't seem to be much different than the sample my sister gave me (which was a different brand).  There is a good bit in the jar.  It's pretty firm, so it's a little hard to dig out at first; but once your hands warm it up a little, it softens.  I dig out a small chunk and rub it between my palms.  It melts almost instantly and is ready to rub in.  This just seems to be the right way to take care of your skin as opposed to layering chemical after chemical in hopes that something, anything will work.",5
368124,B003B3OOPA,A3KUQ3M1O3L9DW,"multiple uses, goes a long way","I have never purchased  this type of product before but I am glad I started with this one. The smell is savory coconut. I scrapped some into a small glass pot to keep in the bathroom and I take a small amount, melt it in my palm and treat my hair ends at least 3 times a week with it. I also use it for cooking (great to add to shrimp or anything you want to infuse with a little coconut essence'. Would absolutely go with this brand again.",5

I also use a little before drying my hair for moisturizer.  A little goes a long ways.  One definitely does not want to use too much of this.  I wrap my hair at night in my satin head wrap and unwrap non-greasy, extremely lustrous, well moisturized.  I am African American and naturally have dry relaxed hair, but using this routine bi-weekly, I have hair that does not sound powerfully like snapping twigs when I press it between my fingers near my ears listening for dryness.  I definitely recommend this product for anyone that suffers with dry hair especially if it has been chemically treated.  It is a hair saver.  I do shed hairs as badly as I used to.  It is hair saving.",5
368126,B003B3OOPA,A8YQ8EGT3QBSG,Miracle Oil,"I have only been ingesting this oil and using as a moisturizer for my face, body and hair for a little over a month.  My face and body are hydrated and soft as a baby's butt.  Plus my hair is growing like a weed, soft and shiny.  My biggest thrill came last week when I walked past my entry hall mirror and noticed that the slight sagging on my jawline was firmer and I looked years younger.  When I started this Coconut Oil regimen my blood pressure was 188/92 with medication. Last week it registered 125/75 without medication.  Needless to say I am tickled at the results since deciding to take control of my health naturally and stop relying upon doctors and drugs.  My next natural health cure is switching to naturally alkaline water. I'm told that it also produces miraculous results. Does anyone know of a good brand that is at least a PH balance of 9?",5
368127,B003B3OOPA,A1JTGI1L4JFWG,Lovely Product for Hair,"I love this product, but its a little strange. When it arrived, it was completely liquid. Not exactly sure why, but it was liquid for days. I liked it better this way. As it got colder it became hard as a rock. Which makes measuring it for my hair a little more difficult, but I dont care I love it. If you are using this as a hair moisturizer this feel good hands down. My hair is Shinny for the first time ever and my scalp is moisturized without feeling like it has a pound of grease on it. its light and a little bit goes a long way. I have this on autoship, but i may skip the next order because this is gonna last! I have thick hair and a tablespoon to a tablespoon and a half goes a long long way. I do not feel this product on my head at all. Also works well on skin. I have dry patches on my face, this is a lovely light oil. My mom uses this product as well and she has think straight hair, and she loves it!<br />Warning, do not add too much to your scalp and whatever you do do not leave clumps of this product in your hair. If it is hard, let it warm up in your hand. Reason: I add it in clumps and as i went out in the sun it began to drip down my face like water. I can only liken the experience to Jerry Curl Juice. BUT i love this product!",5
368128,B003B3OOPA,AB4XGHZNQN413,Don't need my eczema medication anymore,"I've mostly used this coconut oil consistently on my skin for a month now. I have eczema and dry skin spots on my torso.<br /><br />So here's my review and my experience... a rant, and advice, I guess.<br /><br />You have to be pretty consistent with this stuff to see results -- if you're starting out with it, I think. I've been using this for a month at least 2 times a day, and it's in the middle of winter when my skin easily gets dry. I stopped using lotion after learning about its ineffectiveness and how it could be in fact harmful (carcinogenic from parabens and such) -- most of the conventional products anyway that we all find easily in our supermarkets.<br /><br />So I've learned that most health products they sell you don't really eliminate the problems at their roots -- mostly just symptoms, and in fact can contribute to cancer (make-up, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, laundry detergent...) This is a very clever business technique, because the customers will always be coming back for more toxic products that eliminate symptoms, but never completely eliminate the root of the customers' problems.<br /><br />I also learned that skin problems can not only be due to toxic chemicals from your conventional lotions, it can be from toxins that sit on the inside of your body from the junk food you've been ingesting -- this includes highly processed foods, toxic medications, the toxins your skin has absorbed over the years, and maybe even the polluted air you've been breathing.(I've been told by a nutritionist that many skin problems can be helped by colon cleansing and perhaps liver cleansing...).<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that coconut oil can only do so much (at least, in my one month of experience) on the outside, it's helping just one factor out of many that would contribute to better skin health. But I'd say it's definitely better than using my prescribed topical medication which are basically steroids (betamethasone dipropionate I think). The doctor said not to use it for more than 10 days in a row (my medication), that it's bad that the skin absorbs it. *ahem* you know that doctors are not going to recommend anything other than drugs that are mostly toxic? my dermatologist was definitely giving me carcinogens, which I found out from my doctor -- so she started prescribing me steroids. that can't be good either now can it, especially when she told me that my skin shouldn't absorb too much of it?<br /><br />It's okay to absorb the coconut oil though, because it's non-toxic, nourishing for the skin, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant and can be used internally as well. So definitely, it's great for eczema. You have to be patient with it, though -- it's not harsh and strong like my steroid cream that works in minutes. The coconut oil on the first few applications within the first day or two will still leave your skin pretty dry (in my experience), but I think it's just a matter of your skin getting used to it or something. Or maybe it's a matter of getting it so that your skin is actually nourished, after all those years of using toxic malnourishing lotions.<br /><br />With acne, it's meh. I have acne on my forehead, and I learned that it's due to the oil from my hair... or, your forehead naturally produces more grease than other parts of the body. At least for me. I didn't see that big a difference with coconut oil in the past month, but I solved my acne on my forehead problem with a facial cleanse at a day spa, followed by applying organic jojoba oil on it day and night for almost a week now... and the acne's pretty much calmed down a lot.<br /><br />My face was really smooth when I consistently used the old lotions -- while I was switching to coconut oil for the first few weeks, my face was kind of dry. But now it's back to smooth, possibly even smoother.<br /><br />I bought another jar for my mom, just for general use. She used it on some sort of super itchy rash (possibly some sort of infection, I had no idea) that just wouldn't go away for months. In her experience, after applying coconut oil, her rash itched like crazy while it was greasy. But after a few days of application, it was getting better and itching less frequently. When she applied the coconut oil at night, it wouldn't wake her up anymore from the itchiness like it used to.<br /><br />I will continue to use organic extra virgin coconut oil, and stay away from toxic substances. I think I'm also going to start cooking with coconut oil as well.<br /><br />The only downside to coconut oil in my experience and/or from what I've read and researched, are:<br /><br />if you don't like the smell<br />if you're allergic<br />if you're too lazy/impatient to switch from conventional lotions to coconut oil<br /><br />Coconut oil is too good to be true. As a huge developed country we're so far removed that we had no idea that we don't really need drugs.  At least for good skin and hair and to slow the aging process, stick to organic extra virgin coconut oil. It's probably the only staple ""cosmetic"" product you'll ever need -- good health leads to beauty.",5
368129,B003B3OOPA,AMZ80S63DXM11,Love this stuff!,"This is the brand I usually purchase at the local co-op, and I am super stoked to see it here for half of what I normally pay so I just purchased two pounds. I can go through a pound in a month because I use it to make deodorant, toothpaste, to oil pull with, as a supplement, to cook with, and as body and hair moisturizer for me and my toddler. We both have very curly hair and dry skin and this is my favorite oil to use. It does have a somewhat strong scent that smells similar to buttered popcorn, haha, but I like it. No one has ever remarked that we smell bad. A few times I've been told we smell like pastry or coconut or ""something vaguely familiar"" and whenever I mention popcorn usually people agree. Anyways, I love this for first aid (rashes, cuts, burns) and to fend of sickness (often I can take a TBS and oil pull and feel better within an hour). Word of caution: take it easy if you are taking this internally at first. I've thrown up from taking too much on an empty stomach before (felt better immediately after, though). The die-off from bacteria can cause you to have ""detox sickness"". Oh! And it helps make breastmilk richer too. I really hope it will stay at this price long enough for me to make my next order.

About once a week I put a couple tablespoons full in a bath and wow it has done wonders for my skin. My skin is softer, I have gotten rid of most of these little bumps I had on the back of my thighs and arms. I have used it as a hair conditioner, leaving it in my hair overnight and then showering the next morning. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy. I also use it as a spread on my waffle, just a tablespoon on a whole grain waffle with some jelly, it tastes great and it good for your metabolism and health all around. it is high in saturated fat so you have to be careful but I think the good of this product out weights that. all in all I recommend it.",5

Use it monthly as a conditioning treatment on my hair.  Just use caution if u go to a water park and slide down the water slides. I've never slid so fast in my life. ;),5
368137,B003B3OOPA,A2V5R832QCSOMX,Really versatile,"I've been using either Nature's Way or Nutiva coconut oil for several years, and love how versatile it is.  Not only can you use it for cooking and baking (and even around the edges of bakeware or in a frying pan in place of olive oil), but you can also use it for personal care.<br /><br />To do so, I scoop some into a small container so I don't have to dip my fingers in the larger jar.  I keep the large jar in my kitchen for cooking purposes, and then small container in my bathroom, where I use it as an eye makeup remover when I have heavy makeup on, as a skin moisturizer, and as a hair treatment.  For the hair, a small amount rubbed/melted into your palms and smoothed on over hair helps with flyaways, and a larger amount rubbed in before bed or twenty minutes before washing serves as a deep treatment. (Oftentimes, I'll put it in my hair before I go workout so that the heat helps it penetrate.)  Since coconut oil is easily absorbed by the hair, it makes for a great conditioner.<br /><br />The Nature's Way brand has consistent quality and tastes very good. It's a staple item in our house.",5
368138,B003B3OOPA,A3CJZ7BTAYA01B,And to think this has always been around,"I love this product soooo much; I use it on my skin after a really hot bath and it just melts into your skin. It does not leave an oilly or greasy feel behind (my skin just drinks it up) and even if I don't put it on for a day or two, it still feels like I did.<br />You can eat it cause ........ well it's food and you can cook with it bake with it. I tryed it on a spoon, it has a suttle tast of an amond joy or mounds bar. Just a hint of chocolate and toasted nuts. I also use it on my hair to keep it moist since I just discovered the trend of natrual hair and hair styles for natural hair. I stopped the relxars in 1998 but was still hardheaded about the box braids etc. My stylest finally got me to understand that less is more.so for over 10 years it's just been wash consi and flat iron. I did have color put in a year ago and it's almost grown out. But I wanted to try something diffrent that I would'nt regret later. and the blow out braid out works very well for me. The Coconut oil is organic and not something you go to a hair supplie place etc to buy. I like it cause I'm feeding my hair and body with something that is natural and good for you.<br /><br />With so many natural coconut oil products out there, how do you choose?. For me I read the reviews first and then looked at the prices and checked afew other places ( okeay one ) but I can't say where. In the end I chose this Coconut oil made by natures way. ( this is my second jar, still have not finished the first jar. Second jar is in the kitchen and the first jar is in the bathroom or bedroom. I am going to buy more and I just turned my aunti on to it. She said "" My goodness, who knew and I,ve been passing by it at the food store for years"".",5
368139,B003B3OOPA,A1WYY5Q4TMAA2A,This is the best stuff ever....very pleased!!!!,"I ordered this product after reading the reviews keeping an optimistic state of mind because I am usally not a follower.  However...this product is more than what everyone say it is.  I am totally hooked.  I put this product in oatmeal, smoothies, whole wheat english muffins.  I even cook my rice in this product.  I am losing weight and enjoy the taste.  I purchase two because I also use this product on my skin in which my skin now look like a movie stars skin.  It is a bit oily however it soaks in the skin and you feel so soft all day.",5
368141,B003B3OOPA,A2GX9LXA6YQCF5,Great for hair,"Being Indian, my mom used to always put coconut oil in my hair so it is my habit to put oil in my hair at least once a week or so. The oil sold at the stores isn't pure so I decided to buy this product on amazon. I have used 2 jars so far and I am in love with it! The oil comes in solid form and then turns into a liquid once you rub it between your palms. I warm the oil in a small container, then apply it to my hair, and leave it overnight to shampoo the next day. I also use this as a skin moisturizer in the winter. I don't use this on my face because my face is tends to be sensitive and flares up even with the most ""organic"" products. So if you are acne prone, then I would suggest testing it out before you apply it.",5
368142,B003B3OOPA,A2KDCXEQWVJ8QX,Real Coconut Oil,"This product is awesome! If you know about real coconut oil (had it fresh in the tropics), you will love this product. My sister brought me some coconut oil from NY (Jamaica's Best I believe) at the same time I ordered this product. I was a little peeved because this product cost much more than the one my sister brought me. As soon as I opened the jar though, I understood why. This is the real McCoy!!",5
368143,B003B3OOPA,A3OQNWCOITZSSH,Didn't buy it for the reason you'd think,Did some research and decided to give this a try as a personal lubricant. I recommend looking it up and giving it a try!,5
368144,B003B3OOPA,A1APJ9BVO8KFTU,Love In A Jar,"I made a few orders, this one came fast and furiously first. I ordered two jars, just in case they are small. But when the package arrived, the jars are pretty big! I opened it up, and the oil smells beautifully !! The coconut oil tastes like the almond joy. I did not really buy this for cooking but for hair and skin care and it melts on the skin like butter !!! I already love it, it smells wonderful and I will continue to use it, so that way I am able to stay away from paraben- containing hair care and skin care products. If they had even larger jars, I would order them !!! Eventually I will order more even for cooking. I really would recommend this, if you have really curly hair to use it in place of hair grease. It will even last longer and it is much cheaper, cleaner and healthier in the longrun !!!<br />I recommend this product to anyone who wants to use it what natuer already has to offer.",5
368145,B003B3OOPA,AXJ1QYBUL86ON,Fresh taste and good consistency - absorbs quickly into skin!,"This coconut oil is an excellent multi-purpose product.  I have used it for cooking, broiling, eating by the spoonful and as a skin moisturizer and massage oil.<br />Last night I put a few pats of this coconut oil on salmon with a salt and herb mix.  I broiled the salmon and it tasted amazing.  The coconut oil definitely enhanced the flavor.<br />I have been using this oil for frying eggs as well.  It does not seem to burn as quickly as olive oil or butter and it also seems that less is needed for frying - probably since it's easier to use small amounts since it is in solid form.<br />This coconut oil also worked well for sauteing tofu and broccoli with Bragg's liquid unfermented soy.<br />It's also tasty on a baked potato and I find that I can skip the salt and still enjoy the flavor.  You can also add it to rice or rice and beans or french fries for a tropical splash of flavor.<br />I combined this coconut oil with olive oil to saute vegetables for a pasta dish and it worked beautifully.<br />It has mild, fresh flavor and a little seems to go a long way.<br /><br />April 19, 2012<br /><br />Still loving this coconut oil.  It tastes great so you could literally eat a spoonful or two if you were hungry and needed instant energy.<br />I packed it for a trip to Florida.  It was solid when I arrived, but liquified once I hit the warmer weather.<br />It also works great in a hot bath for instant moisturizing and it's the perfect after sun moisturizer.  It smells so good that you could use it as a very mild perfume and moisturizer just by rubbing it into your arms and legs until the oil is absorbed - seriously!",5
368147,B003B3OOPA,A1F14BB4PV053A,Great product!!,"This coconut oil is fantastic.  I'll leave you to read the other reviews but leave you with one tip.  If you store your jar on top of the fridge, it will stay soft.  The slight warmth won't be enough to liquify it, but it will keep it manageable for scooping and such.  Enjoy!",5
562971,B007JFMH8M,A368Z46FIKHSEZ,Delicious!,I love these cookies!  Not only are they healthy but they taste great and are so soft!  I will definitely add these to my grocery list!,5
562972,B007JFMH8M,A1JAPP1CXRG57A,Great Anytime of Day!,"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with raisins are a delicious treat, great for anytime of day.  For example:<br /><br />--at breakfast, I had one with a large banana and a cup of coffee, and felt I'd had a relatively ""healthy"" start to the day.<br /><br />--the next day at lunch, following a tuna sandwich, I had one with a glass of milk, and was satisfied enough to not need a snack before dinner at 6:30.<br /><br />--the following night, after dinner, I had one with the remainder of my glass of wine. (Delicious!) And again, didn't feel the need to snack later in the evening.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.<br /><br />While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.<br /><br />Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!",5
562973,B007JFMH8M,A2Z9JNXPIEL2B9,Very good!,"I am usually not a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but these literally melt in your mouth. They are so soft and tasty! I would definitely recommend these to someone who loves oatmeal, and even those like me who would probably pick a different flavor over this one.",5

It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie ""raisins"" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets",5

I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade ""vanishing oatmeal"" cookies.<br />There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.

563081,B007JFMH8M,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,Strong cinnamon spice,"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite. Quaker Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies.",5

563183,B007JFMH8M,ABC68JUCPTVOE,"Tasty, healthy, individually-wrapped oatmeal cookies","These cookies taste really good.  The only oatmeal cookies I like better are the chewy ones made with more sugar (carmelization!).<br /><br />Given the moderate (12g) amount of sugar in these, they taste great, and actually make sense as an energy snack.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Fiber!  4g per cookie.<br />- Nutrition: Easy on the fats and sugars.<br />- Soft, semi-chewy texture.  Raisins are just chewy enough.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />None really.<br /><br />Individual packaging is nice for taking them with you.  Always like to see less packaging but these aren't too wasteful on materials.<br /><br />Recommended.",5

563187,B007JFMH8M,AWKZAUC0D8DYL,Quality Cookie,"My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies.",5

As I was going through all the products I was sent to test I opened the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie and ate it. I was pleasantly surprised. I have not eaten an Oatmeal cookie since I was a kid.  Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The Quaker cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal. I have already bought two boxes of these and will continue to add these cookies to my bi-monthly grocery lists.  Try these cookies you will not regret it!!,5

The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with.",5

So I was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie.

The raisins, the oats and you could even taste the cinnamon that's in the cookie. It was so delicious, even my kids loved it! I have 4 kids: 2 year old, 3 year old, 6 year old and a 11 year old and they all enjoyed a piece of the cookie. The little ones even started crying when it was all done.

These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid.

At first I was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. I will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when I need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a Mom Voxbox through Influenster, which contained a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies.

563445,B007JFMH8M,A28GJHVEB3ZFV1,Picky Eater loves them,"I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a Quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there.",5

I rarely purchase premade cookies, because they are too hard for my preference, but this changes my mind.  They are full of flavor.

563514,B007JFMH8M,A3K8AU6BAGN60E,Everyone in the family loves these cookies.,"These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest (35) to the youngest (17 months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an ""oatmeal"" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies.",5

563834,B007JFMH8M,A186RQLMYP1VNG,Delicious,I really loved the taste of these cookies. They tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies. They seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies. I used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind. I would definitely buy these again.,5

So I went to Walmart to buy more. All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up 1 cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why.

563849,B007JFMH8M,A1KNMUQUT0E467,delicious,I receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from influenster it was delicious I have never tried these but I would recommend them to anyone,5
563850,B007JFMH8M,A2I60HCAVEF3RC,"Very Good, Very Natural Tasting, Great Texture","<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:14 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway.",5
563851,B007JFMH8M,AKGD6454LHII6,I can't believe these are not homemade!,"I received Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.<br /><br />With only 6 grams of fat,170 calories, and 12g of sugar per serving (1 cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!",5

It tasted like a homemade cookie to me. I love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones. I went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well. My family loves the Quaker brand and will continue to buy and recommend Quaker.,5

563870,B007JFMH8M,AES9VNGFZLOE1,Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies,"~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)<br />~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />~ The Verdict: Next time you're at the store, don't leave without picking up some Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies!

563871,B007JFMH8M,A22QAN7HTA6R7L,Just Like Mom Used to Make....,The cookie didn't make it much further than out of the box. It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one.,5
563875,B007JFMH8M,A1YJMG0QJXZLD4,Very nice cookie,"I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.<br /><br />These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is 170 calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.<br />I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again.",5
